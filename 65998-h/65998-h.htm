&ldquo;Swell out, sad harmonies,<br/>

A death-crowned queen, from her hid throne she scatters<br/>
Smiles and tears<br/>

Until Time turn aside,<br/>

ERNEST&rsquo;S APPEARANCE</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Come here, boy, let me look at you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest advanced a step or two and looked his uncle in the face. He was a
noble-looking lad of about thirteen, with large dark eyes, black hair that
curled over his head, and the unmistakable air of breeding that marks
Englishmen of good race.
</p>

<p>
His uncle let his wandering glance stray round him, but, wandering as it was,
it seemed to take him in from top to toe. Presently he spoke again:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I like you, boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest said nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see&mdash;your second name is Beyton. I am glad they called you
Beyton; it was your grandmother&rsquo;s maiden name, and a good old name too.
Ernest Beyton Kershaw. By the way, have you ever seen anything of your other
uncle, Sir Hugh Kershaw?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy&rsquo;s cheek flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I have not; and I never wish to,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because when my mother wrote to him before she died&rdquo;&mdash;and
here the lad&rsquo;s voice choked&mdash;&ldquo;just after the bank broke and
she lost all her money, he wrote back and said that because his brother&mdash;I
mean my father&mdash;had made a low marriage, that was no reason why he should
support his child and widow; but he sent her five pounds to go on with. She
sent it back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was like your mother, she always had a high spirit. He must be a
cur, and he does not speak the truth. Your mother comes of a better stock than
the Kershaws. The Carduses are one of the oldest families in the Eastern
counties. Why, boy, our family lived down in the Fens by Lynn there for
centuries, until your grandfather, poor weak man, got involved in his great
lawsuit and ruined us all. There, there, it has gone into the law, but it is
coming back, it is coming back fast. This Sir Hugh has only one son, by the
way. Do you know that if anything happened to him you would be next in the
entail?&mdash;at any rate you would get the baronetcy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want his baronetcy,&rdquo; said Ernest, sulkily; &ldquo;I
will have nothing of his.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A title, boy, is an incorporeal hereditament, for which the holder is
indebted to nobody. It does not descend to him, it vests in him. But tell me,
how long was this before your mother died&mdash;that he sent the five pounds, I
mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;About three months.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus hesitated a little before he spoke again, tapping his white fingers
nervously on the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope my sister was not in want, Ernest?&rdquo; he said, jerkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For a fortnight before she died we had scarcely enough to eat,&rdquo;
was the blunt reply.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus turned himself to the window, and for a minute the light of the dull
December day shone and glistened upon his brow and head, which was perfectly
bald. Then before he spoke he drew himself back into the shadow, perhaps to
hide something like a tear that shone in his soft black eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why did she not appeal to me? I could have helped her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She said that when you quarrelled with her about her marrying my father,
you told her never to write or speak to you again, and that she never
would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why did you not do it, boy? You knew how things were.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because we had begged once, and I would not beg again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; muttered Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;the old spirit cropping up. Poor
Rose, nearly starving, and dying too, and I with so much which I do not want!
O, boy, boy, when you are a man never set up an idol, for it frightens good
spirits away. Nothing else can live in its temple; it is a place where all
other things are forgotten&mdash;duty, and the claims of blood, and sometimes
those of honour too. Look now, I have my idol, and it has made me forget my
sister and your mother. Had she not written at last when she was dying, I
should have forgotten you too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy looked up puzzled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An idol!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; went on his uncle in his dreamy way&mdash;&ldquo;an idol.
Many people have them; they keep them in the cupboard with their family
skeleton; sometimes the two are identical. And they call them by many names,
too; frequently it is a woman&rsquo;s name; sometimes that of a passion;
sometimes that of a vice, but a virtue&rsquo;s&mdash;not often.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is the name of yours, uncle?&rdquo; asked the wondering boy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mine? O, never mind!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment a swing-door in the side of the room was opened, and a tall bony
woman with beady eyes came through.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. de Talor to see you, sir, in the office.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus whistled softly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;tell him I am coming. By the way, Grice, this
young gentleman has come to live here; his room is ready, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir; Miss Dorothy has been seeing to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good; where is Miss Dorothy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She has walked into Kesterwick, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, and Master Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is about, sir; I saw him pass with a ferret a while back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell Sampson or the groom to find him and send him to Master Ernest
here. That will do, thank you. Now, Ernest, I must go. I hope that you will be
pretty happy here, my boy, when your trouble has worn off a bit. You will have
Jeremy for a companion; he is a lout, and an unpleasant lout, it is true, but I
suppose that he is better than nobody. And then there is
Dorothy&rdquo;&mdash;and his voice softened as he muttered her
name&mdash;&ldquo;but she is a girl.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who are Dorothy and Jeremy?&rdquo; broke in his nephew; &ldquo;are they
your children?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus started perceptibly, and his thick white eyebrows contracted over
his dark eyes till they almost met.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Children!&rdquo; he said, sharply; &ldquo;I have no children. They are
my wards. Their name is Jones;&rdquo; and he left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he <i>is</i> a rum sort,&rdquo; reflected Ernest to himself,
&ldquo;and I don&rsquo;t think I ever saw such a shiny head before. I wonder if
he oils it? But, at any rate, he is kind to me. Perhaps it would have been
better if mother had written to him before. She might have gone on living,
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Rubbing his hand across his face to clear away the water gathering in his eyes
at the thought of his dead mother, Ernest made his way to the wide fireplace at
the top end of the room, peeped into the ancient inglenooks on each side, and
at the old Dutch tiles with which it was lined, and then, lifting his coat
after a grown-up fashion, proceeded to warm himself and inspect his
surroundings. It was a curious room in which he stood, and its leading feature
was old oak panelling. All down its considerable length the walls were oak-clad
to the low ceiling, which was supported by enormous beams of the same material;
the shutters of the narrow windows which looked out on the sea were oak, and so
were the doors and table, and even the mantelshelf. The general idea given by
the display of so much timber was certainly one of solidity, but it could
scarcely be called cheerful&mdash;not even the numerous suits of armour and
shining weapons which were placed about upon the walls could make it cheerful.
It was a remarkable room, but its effect upon the observer was undoubtedly
depressing.
</p>

<p>
Just as Ernest was beginning to realise this fact, things were made more lively
by the sudden appearance through the swing-door of a large savage-looking
bull-terrier, which began to steer for the fireplace, where it was evidently
accustomed to lie. On seeing Ernest it stopped and sniffed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, good dog!&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
The dog growled and showed its teeth.
</p>

<p>
Ernest put out his leg towards it as a caution to it to keep off. It
acknowledged the compliment by sending its teeth through his trousers. Then the
lad, growing wroth, and being not free from fear, seized the poker and hit the
dog over the head so shrewdly that the blood streamed from the blow, and the
brute, losing his grip, turned and fled howling.
</p>

<p>
While Ernest was yet warm with the glow of victory, the door once more swung
open, violently this time, and through it there came a boy of about his own
age, a dirty deep-chested boy, with uncut hair, and a slow heavy face in which
were set great gray eyes, just now ablaze with indignation. On seeing Ernest he
pulled up much as the dog had done, and regarded him angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you hit my dog?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hit a dog,&rdquo; replied Ernest politely, &ldquo;but&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your &lsquo;buts.&rsquo; Can you fight?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest inquired whether this question was put with a view of gaining general
information or for any particular purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can you fight?&rdquo; was the only rejoinder.
</p>

<p>
Slightly nettled, Ernest replied that under certain circumstances he could
fight like a tom-cat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then look out; I&rsquo;m going to make your head as you have made my
dog&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest, in the polite language of youth, opined that there would be hair and
toe-nails flying first.
</p>

<p>
To this sally, Jeremy Jones, for it was he, replied only by springing at him,
his hair streaming behind like a Red Indian&rsquo;s, and, smiting him severely
in the left eye, caused him to measure his length upon the floor. Arising
quickly, Ernest returned the compliment with interest; but this time they both
went down together, pummelling each other heartily. With whom the victory would
ultimately have remained could scarcely be doubtful, for Jeremy, who even at
that age gave promise of the enormous physical strength which afterwards made
him such a noted character, must have crushed his antagonist in the end. But
while his strength still endured Ernest was fighting with such ungovernable
fury, and such a complete disregard of personal consequences, that he was for a
while, at any rate, getting the best of it. And luckily for him, while matters
were yet in the balanced scales of Fate, an interruption occurred. For at that
moment there rose before the blurred sight of the struggling boys a vision of a
small woman&mdash;at least she looked like a woman&mdash;with an indignant
little face and an uplifted forefinger.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, you wicked boys! what will Reginald say, I should like to know? O,
you bad Jeremy! I am ashamed to have such a brother. Get up!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My eye!&rdquo; said Jeremy thickly, for his lip was cut;
&ldquo;it&rsquo;s Dolly!&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap02"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/>
REGINALD CARDUS, ESQ., MISANTHROPE</h2>

<p>
When Mr. Cardus left the sitting-room where he had been talking to Ernest, he
passed down a passage in the rambling old house which led him into a courtyard.
On the farther side of the yard, which was walled in, stood a neat red-brick
building one story high, consisting of two rooms and a passage. On to this
building were attached a series of low green-houses, and against the wall at
the farther end of these houses was a lean-to in which stood the boiler that
supplied the pipes with hot water. The little red-brick building was Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s office, for he was a lawyer by profession; the long tail of
glass behind it were his orchid-houses, for orchid-growing was his sole
amusement. The <i>tout ensemble</i>, office and orchid-houses, seemed curiously
out of place in the gray and ancient courtyard where they stood, looking as
they did on to the old one-storied house, scarred by the passage of centuries
of tempestuous weather. Some such idea seemed to strike Mr. Cardus as he closed
the door behind him, preparatory to crossing the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Queer contrast,&rdquo; he muttered to himself; &ldquo;very queer.
Something like that between Reginald Cardus, Esquire, Misanthrope, of
Dum&rsquo;s Ness, and Mr. Reginald Cardus, Solicitor, Chairman of the Stokesly
Board of Guardians, Bailiff of Kesterwick, etc. And yet in both cases they are
part of the same establishment. Case of old and new style!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus did not make his way straight to the office. He struck off to the
right, and entered the long line of glass-houses, walking up from house to
house, till he reached the partition where the temperate sort were placed to
bloom, and which was connected with his office by a glass door. Through this
last he walked softly, with a cat-like step, till he reached the door, where he
paused to observe a large coarse man, who was standing at the far end of the
room, looking out intently on the courtyard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my friend,&rdquo; he said to himself, &ldquo;so the shoe is
beginning to pinch. Well, it is time.&rdquo; Then he pushed the door softly
open, passed into the room with the same cat-like step, closed it, and, seating
himself at his writing-table, took up a pen. Apparently the coarse-looking man
at the window was too much absorbed in his own thoughts to hear him, for he
still stood staring into space.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. de Talor,&rdquo; said the lawyer presently, in his soft, jerky
voice, &ldquo;I am at your service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The person addressed started violently, and turned sharply round. &ldquo;Good
&rsquo;eavens, Cardus, how did you get in?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Through the door, of course; do you suppose I came down the
chimney?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s very strange, Cardus, but I never &rsquo;eard you come.
You&rsquo;ve given me quite a start.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus laughed, a hard, little laugh. &ldquo;You were too much occupied
with your own thoughts, Mr. de Talor. I fear that they are not pleasant ones.
Can I help you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you know that my thoughts are not pleasant, Cardus? I never said
so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If we lawyers waited for our clients to tell us all their thoughts, Mr.
de Talor, it would often take us a long time to reach the truth. We have to
read their faces, or even their backs sometimes. You have no idea of how much
expression a back is capable, if you make such things your study; yours, for
instance, looks very uncomfortable to-day: nothing gone wrong, I hope?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Cardus, no,&rdquo; answered Mr. de Talor, dropping the subject of
backs, which was, he felt, beyond him; &ldquo;that is, nothing much, merely a
question of business, on which I have come to ask your advice as a shrewd
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My best advice is at your service, Mr. de Talor: what is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Cardus, it&rsquo;s this.&rdquo; And Mr. de Talor seated his portly
frame in an easy-chair, and turned his broad, vulgar face towards the lawyer.
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s about the railway-grease business&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Which you own up in Manchester?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that&rsquo;s it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, it ought to be a satisfactory subject to talk of. It pays
hand over fist, does it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Cardus, that is just the point: it did pay, it don&rsquo;t
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see, when my father took out the patent, and started the
business, his &rsquo;ouse was the only &rsquo;ouse in the market, and he made a
pot, and, I don&rsquo;t mind telling you, I&rsquo;ve made a pot too; but now,
what do you think?&mdash;there&rsquo;s a beggarly firm called Rastrick &amp;
Codley that took out a new patent last year, and is underselling us with a
better stuff at a cheaper price than we can turn it out at.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, we&rsquo;ve lowered our price to theirs, but we are doing business
at a loss. We hoped to burst them, but they don&rsquo;t burst: there&rsquo;s
somebody backing them, confound them, for Rastrick &amp; Codley ain&rsquo;t
worth a sixpence; but who it is the Lord only knows. I don&rsquo;t believe they
know themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is unfortunate, but what about it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just this, Cardus. I want to ask your advice about selling out. Our
credit is still good, and we could sell up for a large pile&mdash;not so large
as we could have done, but still large&mdash;and I don&rsquo;t know whether to
sell or hold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus looked thoughtful. &ldquo;It is a difficult point, Mr. de Talor, but
for myself I am always against caving in. The other firm may smash after all,
and then you would be sorry. If you were to sell now you would probably make
their fortunes, which I suppose you don&rsquo;t want to do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you are a very wealthy man; you are not dependent on this grease
business. Even if things were to go wrong, you have all your landed property
here at Ceswick&rsquo;s Ness to fall back on. I should hold, if I were you,
even if it was at a loss for a time, and trust to the fortune of war.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor gave a sigh of relief. &ldquo;That&rsquo;s my view, too, Cardus.
You are a shrewd man, and I am glad you jump with me. Damn Rastrick &amp;
Codley, say I!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, damn them by all means,&rdquo; answered the lawyer, with a smile,
as he rose to show his client to the door.
</p>

<p>
On the farther side of the passage was another door, with a glass top to it,
which gave on to a room furnished after the ordinary fashion of a clerk&rsquo;s
office. Opposite this door Mr. de Talor stopped to look at a man who was
within, sitting at a table writing. The man was old, of large size, very
powerfully built, and dressed with extreme neatness in hunting
costume&mdash;boots, breeches, spurs, and all. Over his large head grew tufts
of coarse gray hair, which hung down in dishevelled locks about his face,
giving him a wild appearance, that was added to by a curious distortion of the
mouth. His left arm, too, hung almost helpless by his side.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus laughed as he followed his visitor&rsquo;s gaze. &ldquo;A
curious sort of clerk, eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Mad, dumb, and
half-paralysed&mdash;not many lawyers could show such another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor glanced at the object of their observation uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he&rsquo;s so mad, how can he do clerk&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, he&rsquo;s only mad in a way; he copies beautifully.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has quite lost his memory, I suppose?&rdquo; said De Talor, with
another uneasy glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cardus, with a smile, &ldquo;he has. Perhaps it
is as well. He remembers nothing now but his delusions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor looked relieved. &ldquo;He has been with you many years now,
hasn&rsquo;t he, Cardus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, a great many.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you bring him &rsquo;ere at all?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did I never tell you the story? Then if you care to step back into my
office I will. It is not a long one. You remember when our
friend&rdquo;&mdash;he nodded towards the office&mdash;&ldquo;kept the hounds,
and they used to call him &lsquo;hard-riding Atterleigh&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I remember, and ruined himself over them, like a fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And of course you remember Mary Atterleigh, his daughter, whom we were
all in love with when we were young?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor&rsquo;s broad cheek took a deeper shade of crimson as he nodded
assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then,&rdquo; went on Mr. Cardus, in a voice meant to be indifferent, but
which now and again gave traces of emotion, &ldquo;you will also remember that
I was the fortunate man, and, with her father&rsquo;s consent, was engaged to
be married to Mary Atterleigh so soon as I could show him that my income
reached a certain sum.&rdquo; Here Mr. Cardus paused a moment, and then
continued, &ldquo;But I had to go to America about the great Norwich bank case,
and it was a long job, and travelling was slow then. When I got back, Mary
was&mdash;married to a man called Jones, a friend of yours, Mr. de Talor. He
was staying at your house, Ceswick&rsquo;s Ness, when he met her. But perhaps
you are better acquainted with that part of the story than I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor was looking very uneasy again now.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I know nothing about it. Jones fell in love with her like the rest,
and the next I heard of it was that they were to be married. It was rather
rough on you, eh, Cardus? but, Lord, you shouldn&rsquo;t have been fool enough
to trust her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus smiled, a bitter smile. &ldquo;Yes, it was a little
&lsquo;rough,&rsquo; but that has nothing to do with my story. The marriage did
not turn out well; a curious fatality pursued all who had had any hand in it.
Mary had two children; and then did the best thing she could do&mdash;died of
shame and sorrow. Jones, who was rich, went fraudulently bankrupt, and ended by
committing suicide. Hard-riding Atterleigh flourished for a while, and then
lost his money in horses and a ship-building speculation, and got a paralytic
stroke that took away all his speech and most of his reason. Then I brought him
here to save him from the madhouse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That was kind of you, Cardus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, he is worth his keep, and besides, he is poor Mary&rsquo;s father.
He is under the fixed impression that I am the devil; but that does not
matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;ve got her children too, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have adopted them. The girl reminds me of her mother, though she
will never have her mother&rsquo;s looks. The boy is like old Atterleigh. I do
not care about the boy. But, thank God, they are neither of them like their
father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you knew Jones?&rdquo; said De Talor, sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I met him after his marriage. Oddly enough, I was with him a few
minutes before he destroyed himself. There, Mr. de Talor, I will not detain you
any longer. I thought that you could perhaps tell me something of the details
of Mary&rsquo;s marriage. The story has a fascination for me, its results upon
my own life have been so far-reaching. I am sure that I am not at the bottom of
it yet. Mary wrote to me when she was dying, and hinted at something that I
cannot understand. There was somebody behind who arranged the matter, who
assisted Jones&rsquo;s suit. Well, well, I shall find it all out in time, and
whoever it is will no doubt pay the price of his wickedness, like the others.
Providence has strange ways, Mr. de Talor, but in the end it is a terrible
avenger. What! are you going? Queer talk for a lawyer&rsquo;s office,
isn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Mr. de Talor rose, looking pale, and, merely nodding to Mr. Cardus, left
the room.
</p>

<p>
The lawyer watched him till the door had closed, and then suddenly his whole
face changed. The white eyebrows drew close together, the delicate features
worked, and in the soft eyes there shone a look of hate. He clenched his fists,
and shook them towards the door.
</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;He clenched his fists and shook them towards the
door.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;You liar, you hound!&rdquo; he said aloud. &ldquo;God grant that I may
live long enough to do to you as I have done to them! One a suicide, and one a
paralytic madman; you&mdash;you shall be a beggar, if it takes me twenty years
to make you so. Yes, that will hit you hardest. O Mary! Mary! dead and
dishonoured through you, you scoundrel! O my darling, shall I ever find you
again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And this strange man dropped his head upon the desk before him, and groaned.

<h2><a name="chap03"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>
OLD DUM&rsquo;S NESS</h2>

<p>
When Mr. Cardus came half an hour or so later to take his place at the
dinner-table&mdash;for in those days they dined in the middle of the day at
Dum&rsquo;s Ness&mdash;he was not in a good mood. The pool into which the
records of our individual existence are ever gathering, and which we call our
past, will not often bear much stirring, even when its waters are not bitter.
Certainly Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s would not. And yet that morning he had stirred it
violently enough.
</p>

<p>
In the long, oak-panelled room, used indifferently as a sitting and dining
room, Mr. Cardus found &ldquo;hard-riding Atterleigh&rdquo; and his
grand-daughter, little Dorothy Jones. The old man was already seated at table,
and Dorothy was busying herself cutting bread, looking as composed and grown-up
as though she had been four-and-twenty instead of fourteen. She was a strange
child, with her assured air and woman&rsquo;s ways and dress, her curious
thoughtful face, and her large blue eyes that shone steadily as the light of a
lamp. But just now the little face was more anxious than usual.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Reginald,&rdquo; she began, as soon as he was in the room (for by Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s wish she always called him by his Christian name), &ldquo;I am
sorry to tell you that there has been a sad disturbance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked, with a frown; &ldquo;Jeremy
again?&rdquo; Mr. Cardus could be very stern where Jeremy was concerned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am afraid it is. The two boys&mdash;&rdquo; but it was
unnecessary for her to carry her explanations further, for at that moment the
swing-door opened, and through it appeared the young gentlemen in question,
driven in like sheep by the beady-eyed Grice. Ernest was leading, attempting
the impossible feat of looking jaunty with a lump of raw beefsteak tied over
one eye, and presenting a general appearance that suggested the idea of the
colours of the rainbow in a state of decomposition.
</p>

<p>
Behind him shuffled Jeremy, his matted locks still wet from being pumped on.
But his wounds were either unsuited to the dreadful remedy of raw beefsteak, or
he had adopted in preference an heroic one of his own, of which grease
plentifully sprinkled with flour formed the basis.
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was silence, then Mr. Cardus, with awful politeness, asked
Jeremy what was the meaning of this.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We&rsquo;ve been fighting,&rdquo; answered the boy, sulkily.&rdquo; He
hit&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Jeremy, I don&rsquo;t want the particulars, but I will take
this opportunity to tell you before your sister and my nephew what I think of
you. You are a boor and a lout, and, what is more, you are a coward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this unjust taunt the lad coloured to his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you may colour, but let me tell you that it is cowardly to pick a
quarrel with a boy the moment he sets foot inside my doors&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, uncle,&rdquo; broke in Ernest, who was unable to see anything
cowardly about fighting, an amusement to which he was rather partial himself,
and who thought that his late antagonist was getting more than his due,
&ldquo;I began it, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not true, except in the sense that he had begun it by striking the dog;
nor did this statement produce any great effect on Mr. Cardus, who was
evidently seriously angry with Jeremy on more points than this. But at least it
was one of those well-meant fibs at which the recording angel should not be
offended.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not care who began it,&rdquo; went on Mr. Cardus, angrily,
&ldquo;nor is it about this only that I am angry. You are a discredit to me,
Jeremy, and a discredit to your sister. You are dirty, you are idle; your ways
are not those of a gentleman. I sent you to school&mdash;you ran away. I give
you good clothes&mdash;you will not wear them. I tell you, boy, that I will not
stand it any longer. Now listen. I am going to make arrangements with Mr.
Halford, the clergyman at Kesterwick, to undertake Ernest&rsquo;s education.
You shall go with him; and if I see no improvement in your ways in the course
of the next few months, I shall wash my hands of you. Do you understand me
now?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The boy Jeremy had, during this oration, been standing in the middle of the
room, first on one leg, then on the other. At its conclusion he brought the leg
that was at the moment in the air down to the ground, and stood firm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;what have you to say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have to say,&rdquo; blurted out Jeremy, &ldquo;that I don&rsquo;t want
your education. You care nothing about me,&rdquo; he went on, his gray eyes
flashing and his heavy face lighting up; &ldquo;nobody cares about me except my
dog Nails. Yes, you make a dog of me myself; you throw things to me as I throw
Nails a bone. I don&rsquo;t want your education, and I won&rsquo;t have it. I
don&rsquo;t want the fine clothes you buy for me, and I won&rsquo;t wear them.
I don&rsquo;t want to be a burden on you either. Let me go away and be a
fisher-lad and earn my bread. If it hadn&rsquo;t been for her,&rdquo; pointing
to his sister, who was sitting aghast at his outburst, &ldquo;and for Nails,
I&rsquo;d have gone long ago, I can tell you. At any rate, I should not be a
dog then. I should be earning my living, and have no one to thank for it. Let
me go, I say, where I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be mocked at if I do my fair
day&rsquo;s work. I&rsquo;m strong enough; let me go. There! I&rsquo;ve spoken
my mind now;&rdquo; and the lad broke out into a storm of tears, and, turning,
tramped out of the room.
</p>

<p>
As he went, all Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s wrath seemed to leave him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not think he had so much spirit in him,&rdquo; he said aloud.
&ldquo;Well, let us have our dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At dinner the conversation flagged, the scene that preceded it having
presumably left a painful impression; and Ernest, who was an observant youth,
fell to watching little Dorothy doing the honours of the table: cutting up her
crazed old grandfather&rsquo;s food for him, seeing that everybody had what
they wanted, and generally making herself unobtrusively useful. In due course
the meal came to an end, and Mr. Cardus and old Atterleigh went back to the
office, leaving Dorothy alone with Ernest. Presently the former began to talk.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope that your eye is not painful,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Jeremy hits
very hard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, it&rsquo;s all right. I&rsquo;m used to it. When I was at school
in London I often used to fight. I&rsquo;m sorry for him, though&mdash;your
brother, I mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jeremy! O yes, he is always in trouble, and now I suppose that it will
be worse than ever. I do all I can to keep things smooth, but it is no good. If
he won&rsquo;t go to Mr. Halford&rsquo;s, I am sure I don&rsquo;t know what
will happen;&rdquo; and the little lady sighed deeply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, I daresay that he will go. Let&rsquo;s go and look for him, and try
and persuade him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We might try,&rdquo; she said, doubtfully. &ldquo;Stop a minute, and I
will put on my hat, and then if you will take that nasty thing off your eye, we
might walk on to Kesterwick. I want to take a book, out of which I have been
teaching myself French, back to the cottage where old Miss Ceswick lives, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Presently Dorothy returned, and they went out by the back way to a little room
near the coach-house, where Jeremy stuffed birds and kept his collection of
eggs and butterflies; but he was not there. On inquiring of Sampson, the old
Scotch gardener who looked after Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s orchid-houses, she
discovered that Jeremy had gone out to shoot snipe, having borrowed
Sampson&rsquo;s gun for that purpose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is just like Jeremy,&rdquo; she sighed. &ldquo;He is always going
out shooting instead of attending to things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Can he hit birds flying, then?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hit them!&rdquo; she answered, with a touch of pride; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t think he ever misses them. I wish he could do other things as
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy at once went up at least fifty per cent. in Ernest&rsquo;s estimation.
</p>

<p>
On their way back to the house they peeped in through the office window, and
Ernest saw &ldquo;hard-riding Atterleigh&rdquo; at his work, copying deeds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s your grandfather, isn&rsquo;t he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does he know you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In a sort of a way; but he is quite mad. He thinks that Reginald is the
devil, whom he must serve for a certain number of years. He has got a stick
with numbers of notches on it, and he cuts out a notch every month. It is all
very sad. I think it is a very sad world;&rdquo; and she sighed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why does he wear hunting-clothes?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because he always used to ride a good deal. He loves a horse now.
Sometimes you will see him get up from his writing-table, and the tears come
into his eyes if anybody comes into the yard on horseback. Once he came out and
tried to get on to a horse and ride off, but they stopped him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they let him ride?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, he would soon kill himself. Old Jack Tares, who lives at Kesterwick,
and gets his living by rats and ferrets, used to be whip to grandfather&rsquo;s
hounds when he had them, and says that he always was a little mad about riding.
One moonlight night he and grandfather went out to hunt a stag that had strayed
here out of some park. They put the stag out of a little grove at a place
called Claffton, five miles away, and he took them round by Starton and
Ashleigh, and then came down the flats to the sea, about a mile and a half
below here, just this side of the quicksand. The moon was so bright that it was
almost like day, and for the last mile the stag was in view not more than a
hundred yards in front of the hounds, and the pace was racing. When he came to
the beach he went right through the waves out to the sea, and the hounds after
him, and grandfather after them. They caught him a hundred yards out and killed
him, and then grandfather turned his horse&rsquo;s head and swam back with the
hounds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My eye!&rdquo; was Ernest&rsquo;s comment on this story. &ldquo;And what
did Jack Tares do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, he stopped on the beach and said his prayers; he thought that they
would all be drowned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they passed through the old house, which was built on a little ness or
headland that jutted beyond the level of the shore-line, and across which the
wind swept and raved all the winter long, driving the great waves in cease-less
thunder against the sandy cliffs. It was a desolate spot that the gray and
massive house, of which the roof was secured by huge blocks of rock, looked out
upon, nude of vegetation, save for rank, rush-like grass and plants of
sea-holly. In front was the great ocean, rushing in continually upon the sandy
bulwarks, and with but few ships to break its loneliness. To the left, as far
as the eye could reach ran a line of cliff, out of which the waves had taken
huge mouthfuls, till it was as full of gaps as an old crone&rsquo;s jaw. Behind
this stretched mile upon mile of desolate-looking land, covered for the most
part with ling and heath, and cut up with dikes, whence the water was pumped by
means of windmills, that gave a Dutch appearance to the landscape.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; said Dorothy, pointing to a small white house about a mile
and a half away up the shore-line, &ldquo;that is the lock-house where the
great sluice-gates are, and beyond that is the dreadful quicksand in which a
whole army was once swallowed up, like the Egyptians in the Red Sea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word!&rdquo; said Ernest, much interested; &ldquo;and, I say, did my
uncle build this house?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You silly boy! why, it has been built for hundreds of years. Somebody of
the name of Dum built it, and that is why it is called Dum&rsquo;s Ness; at
least I suppose so. There is an old chart that Reginald has, which was made in
the time of Henry VII., and it is marked as Dum&rsquo;s Ness there, so Dum must
have lived before then. Look,&rdquo; she went on, as, turning to the right,
they rounded the old house and reached the road which ran along the top of the
cliff, &ldquo;there are the ruins of Titheburgh Abbey;&rdquo; and she pointed
to the remains of an enormous church with a still perfect tower, that stood
within a few hundred yards of them, almost upon the edge of the cliff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why don&rsquo;t they build it up again?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy shook her head. &ldquo;Because in a few years the sea will swallow it.
Nearly all the graveyard has gone already. It is the same with Kesterwick,
where we are going. Kesterwick was a great town once. The kings of East Anglia
made it their capital, and a bishop lived there. And after that it was a great
port, with thousands upon thousands of inhabitants. But the sea came on and on
and choked up the harbour, and washed away the cliffs, and they could not keep
it out, and now Kesterwick is nothing but a little village with one fine old
church left. The real Kesterwick lies there, under the sea. If you walk along
the beach after a great gale, you will find hundreds of bricks and tiles washed
from the houses that are going to pieces down in the deep water. Just fancy, on
one Sunday afternoon, in the reign of Queen Elizabeth, three of the parish
churches were washed over the cliff into the sea!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so she went on, telling the listening Ernest tale after tale of the old
town, than which Babylon had not fallen more completely, till they came to a
pretty little modern house bowered up in trees&mdash;that is, in summer, for
there were no leaves upon them now&mdash;with which Ernest was destined to
become very well acquainted in after years.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy left her companion at the gate while she went in to leave her book,
remarking that she would be ashamed to introduce a boy with so black an eye.
Presently she came back again, saying that Miss Ceswick was out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who is Miss Ceswick?&rdquo; asked Ernest, who at this period of his
existence had a burning thirst for information of every sort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She is a very beautiful old lady,&rdquo; was Dorothy&rsquo;s answer.
&ldquo;Her family lived for many years at a place called Ceswick&rsquo;s Ness;
but her brother lost all his money gambling, and the place was sold, and Mr. de
Talor, that horrid fat man whom you saw drive away this morning, bought
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Does she live alone?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but she has some nieces, the daughters of her brother who is dead,
and whose mother is very ill; and if she dies one of them is coming to live
with her. She is just my age, so I hope she will come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
After this there was silence for a while.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said the little woman presently, &ldquo;you look kind, so
I will ask you. I want you to help me about Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest, feeling much puffed up at the compliment implied, expressed his
willingness to do anything he could.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, Ernest,&rdquo; she went on, fixing her sweet blue eyes on his
face, &ldquo;Jeremy is a great trouble to me. He will go his own way. And he
does not like Reginald, and Reginald does not like him. If Reginald comes in at
one door, Jeremy goes out at the other. And besides he always flies in
Reginald&rsquo;s face. And, you see, it is not right of Jeremy, because after
all Reginald is very kind to us, and there is no reason he should be, except
that I believe he was fond of our mother; and if it was not for Reginald, whom
I love very much, though he is curious sometimes, I don&rsquo;t know what would
become of grandfather or us. And so, you see, I think that Jeremy ought to
behave better to him, and I want to ask you to bear with his rough ways, and
try and be friends with him and get him to behave better. It is not much for
him to do in return for all your uncle&rsquo;s kindness. You see, I can do a
little something, because I look after the housekeeping; but he does nothing.
And first I want you to get him to make no more trouble about going to Mr.
Halford&rsquo;s.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;ll try; but, I say, how do you learn? you seem to
know an awful lot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, I teach myself in the evenings. Reginald wanted to get me a
governess, but I would not. How should I ever get Grice and the servants to
obey me if they saw that I had to do what a strange woman told me? It would not
do at all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then they were passing the ruins of Titheburgh Abbey. It was almost dark,
for the winter&rsquo;s evening was closing in rapidly, when suddenly Dorothy
gave a little shriek, for from behind a ruined wall there rose up an armed
mysterious figure with something white behind it. Next second she saw that it
was Jeremy, who had returned from shooting, and was apparently waiting for
them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Jeremy, how you frightened me! What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to <i>him,</i>&rdquo; was the laconic reply.
</p>

<p>
Ernest stood still, wondering what was coming.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here! You told a lie to try to save me from catching it this
morning. You said that you began it. You didn&rsquo;t. I began it. I&rsquo;d
have told him too,&rdquo; and he jerked his thumb in the direction of
Dum&rsquo;s Ness, &ldquo;only my mouth was so full of words I could not get it
out. But I want to say I thank you, and here, take the dog. He&rsquo;s a nasty
tempered devil, but he&rsquo;ll grow very fond of you if you are kind to
him;&rdquo; and seizing the astonished Nails by the collar, he thrust him
towards Ernest.
</p>

<p>
For a moment there was a struggle in Ernest&rsquo;s mind, for he greatly longed
to possess a bull-terrier dog; but his gentleman-like feeling prevailed.
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want the dog, and I didn&rsquo;t do anything in
particular.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, you did, though,&rdquo; replied Jeremy, greatly relieved that
Ernest did not accept his dog, which he loved, &ldquo;or at least you did more
than anybody ever did before; but I tell you what, I&rsquo;ll do as much for
you one day. I&rsquo;ll do anything you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you, though?&rdquo; answered Ernest, who was a sharp youth, and
opportunely remembered Dorothy&rsquo;s request.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, come to this fellow Halford with me; I don&rsquo;t want to
go alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy slowly rubbed his face with the back of an exceedingly dirty hand. This
was more than he had bargained for, but his word was his word.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo; And then
whistling to his dog, he vanished into the shadows. And thus began a friendship
between these two that endured all their lives.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap04"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>
BOYS TOGETHER</h2>

<p>
Jeremy kept his word. On the appointed day he appeared ready, as he expressed
it, to &ldquo;tackle that bloke Halford.&rdquo; What is more, he appeared with
his hair cut, a decent suit of clothes on, and, wonder of wonders, his hands
properly washed, for all of which he was rewarded by finding that the
&ldquo;tackling&rdquo; was not such a fearful business as he had anticipated.
It was, moreover, of an intermittent nature, for the lads found plenty of time
to indulge in every sort of manly exercise together. In winter they would roam
all over the wide marsh-lands in search of snipe and wild ducks, which Ernest
missed and Jeremy brought down with unerring aim, and in summer they would
swim, or fish, and bird-nest to their hearts&rsquo; content. In this way they
contrived to combine the absorption of a little learning with that of a really
extended knowledge of animal life and a large quantity of health and spirits.
</p>

<p>
They were happy years, those, for both the lads, and to Jeremy, when he
compared them to his life as it had been before Ernest came, they seemed
perfectly heavenly. For whether it was that he had improved in his manners
since then, or that Ernest stood as a buffer between him and Mr. Cardus, it
certainly happened that he came into collision with him far less often. Indeed,
it seemed to Jeremy that the old gentleman (it was the fashion to call Mr.
Cardus old, though he was in reality only middle-aged) was more tolerant of him
than formerly, though he knew that he would never be a favourite. As for
Ernest, everybody loved the boy, and then, as afterwards, he was a great
favourite with women, who would one and all do anything he asked. It was a
wonder that he did not get spoiled by it all; but he did not. It was not
possible to know Ernest Kershaw at any period of his life without taking a
fancy to him, he was so eminently and unaffectedly a gentleman, and so
completely free from any sort of swagger. Always ready to do a kindness, and
never forgetting one done, generous with his possessions to such an extent that
he seemed to have a vague idea that they were the common property of his
friends and himself, possessing that greatest of gifts, a sympathetic mind, and
true as steel, no wonder that he was always popular both with men and women.
</p>

<p>
Ernest grew into a handsome lad, too, as soon as he began to get his height,
with a shapely form, a beautiful pair of eyes, and an indescribable appearance
of manliness and spirit. But the greatest charm of his face was always its
quick intelligence and unvarying kindliness.
</p>

<p>
As for Jeremy, he did not change much; he simply expanded, and, to tell the
truth, expanded very largely. Year by year his form assumed more and more
enormous proportions, and his strength grew more and more abnormal. As for his
mind, it did not grow with the same rapidity, and was loth to admit a new idea;
but once it was admitted, it never came out again.
</p>

<p>
And he had a ruling passion, too, this dull giant, and that was his intense
affection and admiration for Ernest. It was an affection that grew with his
growth till it became a part of himself, increasing with the increasing years,
till at last it was nearly pathetic in its entirety. It was but rarely that he
parted from Ernest, except, indeed, on those occasions when Ernest chose to go
abroad to pursue his study of foreign languages, of which he was rather fond.
Then, and then only, Jeremy would strike. He disliked parting with Ernest much,
but he objected&mdash;being intensely insular&mdash;to cohabit with foreigners
yet more, so on these occasions, and these only, for a while they separated.
</p>

<p>
So the years wore on till, when they were eighteen, Mr. Cardus, after his
sudden fashion, announced his intention of sending them both to Cambridge.
Ernest always remembered it, for it was on that very day that he first made the
acquaintance of Florence Ceswick. He had just issued from his uncle&rsquo;s
presence, and was seeking Dolly, to communicate the intelligence to her, when
he suddenly blundered in upon old Miss Ceswick, and with her a young lady. This
young lady, to whom Miss Ceswick introduced him as her niece, at once attracted
his attention. On being introduced the girl, who was about his own age, touched
his outstretched palm with her slender fingers, throwing on him at the same
moment so sharp a look from her brown eyes that he afterwards declared to
Jeremy that it seemed to go right through him. She was a remarkable-looking
girl. The hair, which curled profusely over a shapely head, was, like the eyes,
brown; the complexion olive, the features were small, and the lips full,
curving over a beautiful set of teeth. In person she was rather short, but
squarely built, and at her early age her figure was perfectly formed. Indeed,
she might to all appearance have been much older than she was. There was little
of the typical girl about her. While he was still observing her, his uncle came
into the room, and was duly introduced by the old lady to her niece, who had,
she said, come to share her loneliness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how do you like Kesterwick, Miss Florence?&rdquo; asked Mr. Cardus,
with his usual courtly smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is much what I expected&mdash;a little duller, perhaps,&rdquo; she
answered composedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, perhaps you have been accustomed to a gayer spot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, till my mother died we lived at Brighton; there is plenty of life
there. Not that we could mix in it, we were too poor; but at any rate we could
watch it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you like life, Miss Florence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we only live such a short time. I should like,&rdquo; she went on,
throwing her head back, and half-closing her eyes, &ldquo;to see as much as I
can, and to exhaust every emotion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps, Miss Florence, you would find some of them rather
unpleasant,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cardus, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Possibly, but it is better to travel through a bad country than to grow
in a good one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus smiled again: the girl interested him rather.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, Miss Ceswick,&rdquo; he said, changing the subject, and
addressing the stately old lady, who was sitting smoothing her laces, and
looking rather aghast at her niece&rsquo;s utterances, &ldquo;that this young
gentleman is going to college, and Jeremy, too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed,&rdquo; said Miss Ceswick; &ldquo;I hope that you will do great
things there, Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
While Ernest was disclaiming any intentions of the sort, Miss Florence cut in
again, raising her eyes from a deep contemplation of that young
gentleman&rsquo;s long shanks, which were writhing under her keen glance, and
twisting themselves serpent-wise round the legs of the chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not know,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that they took <i>boys</i> at
college.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they took their leave, and Ernest stigmatised her to Dorothy as a
&ldquo;beast.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But she was at least attractive in her own peculiar fashion, and during the
next year or two he got pretty intimate with her.
</p>

<p>
And so Ernest and Jeremy went up to Cambridge, but did not set the place on
fire, nor were the voices of tutors loud in their praise. Jeremy, it is true,
rowed one year in the &rsquo;Varsity Race, and performed prodigies of strength,
and so covered himself with a sort of glory, which, personally, being of a
modest mind, he did not particularly appreciate. Ernest did not even do that.
But somehow, by hook or by crook, at the termination of their collegiate
career, they took some sort of degree, and then departed from the shores of the
Cam, on which they had spent many a jovial day&mdash;Jeremy to return to
Kesterwick, and Ernest to pay several visits to college friends in town and
elsewhere.
</p>

<p>
And so ended the first little round of their days.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap05"></a>CHAPTER V<br/>
EVA&rsquo;S PROMISE.</h2>

<p>
When, on leaving Cambridge, Jeremy got back to Dum&rsquo;s Ness, Mr. Cardus
received him with his usual semi-contemptuous coldness, a mental attitude that
often nearly drove the young fellow wild with mortification. Not that Mr.
Cardus really felt any contempt for him now&mdash;he had lost all that years
ago, when the boy had been so anxious to go and &ldquo;earn his bread;&rdquo;
but he could never forgive him for being the son of his father, or conquer his
inherent dislike to him. On the other hand, he certainly did not allow this to
interfere with his treatment of the lad; if anything, indeed, it made him more
careful. What he spent upon Ernest, the same sum he spent on Jeremy, pound for
pound; but there was this difference about it&mdash;the money he spent on
Ernest he gave from love, and that on Jeremy from a sense of duty.
</p>

<p>
Now, Jeremy knew all this well enough, and it made him very anxious to earn his
own living, and become independent of Mr. Cardus. But it was one thing to be
anxious to earn your own living, and quite another to do it, as many a poor
wretch knows to his cost, and when Jeremy set his slow brain to consider how he
should go about the task it quite failed to supply him with any feasible idea.
And yet he did not want much; Jeremy was not of an ambitious temperament. If he
could earn enough to keep a cottage over his head, and find himself in food and
clothes, and powder and shot, he would be perfectly content. Indeed, there were
to be only two <i>sine qua nons</i> in his ideal occupation: it must admit of a
considerable amount of outdoor exercise, and be of such a nature as would
permit him to see plenty of Ernest. Without more or less of Ernest&rsquo;s
company, life would not, he considered, be worth living.
</p>

<p>
For a week or more after his arrival home these perplexing reflections simmered
incessantly inside Jeremy&rsquo;s head, till at length, feeling that they were
getting too much for him, he determined to consult his sister, which, as she
had three times his brains, he would have done well to think of before.
</p>

<p>
Dolly fixed her steady blue eyes upon him and listened to his tale in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so you see, Doll&rdquo;&mdash;he always called her Doll&mdash;he
ended up, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m in a regular fix. I don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m
fit for, unless it&rsquo;s to row a boat, or let myself out to bad shots to
kill their game for them. You see I must stick on to Ernest; I don&rsquo;t feel
somehow as though I could get along without him; if it wasn&rsquo;t for that
I&rsquo;d emigrate. I should be just the chap to cut down big trees in
Vancouver&rsquo;s Island or brand bullocks,&rdquo;&rsquo; he added
meditatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a great goose, Jeremy,&rdquo; was his sister&rsquo;s comment.
</p>

<p>
He looked up, not as in any way disputing her statement, but merely for further
information.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a great goose, I say. What do you suppose that I have been doing
all these three years and more that you have been rowing boats and wasting time
up at college? <i>I</i> have been thinking, Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and so have I, but there is no good in thinking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not if you stop there; but I&rsquo;ve been acting too. I&rsquo;ve
spoken to Reginald, and made a plan, and he has accepted my plan.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You always were clever, Doll; you&rsquo;ve got all the brains and
I&rsquo;ve got all the size;&rdquo; and he surveyed as much as he could see of
himself ruefully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t ask what I have arranged,&rdquo; she said, sharply, for
in alluding to her want of stature Jeremy had touched a sore point.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am waiting for you to tell me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you are to be articled to Reginald.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Lord!&rdquo; groaned Jeremy, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like that at
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be quiet till I have told you. You are to be articled to Reginald, and
he is to pay you an allowance of a hundred a year while you are articled, so
that if you don&rsquo;t like it you needn&rsquo;t live here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t like the business, Doll; I hate it; it is a beastly
business; it&rsquo;s a devil&rsquo;s business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should like to know what right you have to talk like that, Mr.
Knowall! Let me tell you that many better men than you are content to earn
their living by lawyer&rsquo;s work. I suppose that a man can be honest as a
lawyer as well as in any other trade.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy shook his head doubtfully. &ldquo;It&rsquo;s blood-sucking,&rdquo; he
said energetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you must suck blood,&rdquo; she answered, with decision.
&ldquo;Look here, Jeremy, don&rsquo;t be pig-headed and upset all my plans. If
you fall out with Reginald over this, he won&rsquo;t do anything else for you.
He doesn&rsquo;t like you, you know, and would be only too glad to pick a
quarrel with you if he could do it with a clear conscience, and then where
would you be, I should like to know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy was unable to form an opinion as to where he would be, so she went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must take to it for the present, at any rate. And then there is
another thing to think of. Ernest is to go to the bar, and unless you become a
lawyer, if anything happened to Reginald, there will be nobody to give him a
start, and I&rsquo;m told that is everything at the bar.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This last Jeremy admitted to be a weighty argument.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a precious rum sort of lawyer I shall make,&rdquo; he said, sadly,
&ldquo;about as good as grandfather yonder, I&rsquo;m thinking. By the way, how
has he been getting on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, just as usual&mdash;write, write, write all day. He thinks that he is
working out his time. He has got a new stick now, on which he has nicked all
the months and years that have to run before he has done&mdash;little nicks for
the months and big ones for the years. There are eight or ten big ones left
now. Every month he cuts out a nick. It is very dreadful. You know he thinks
that Reginald is the devil, and he hates him, too. The other day, when he had
no writing to do in the office, I found him drawing pictures of him with horns
and a tail, such awful pictures, and I think Reginald always looks like that to
him. And then sometimes he wants to go out riding, especially at night. Only
last week they found him putting a bridle on to the gray mare&mdash;the one
that Reginald sometimes rides, you know. When did you say that Ernest was
coming back?&rdquo; she said, after a pause.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Doll, I told you&mdash;next Monday week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her face fell a little. &ldquo;O, I thought you said Saturday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you want to know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, only about getting his room ready.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it is ready; I looked in yesterday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! you know nothing about it,&rdquo; she answered,
colouring. &ldquo;Come, I wish you would go out; I want to count the linen, and
you are in the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus adjured, Jeremy removed his large form from the table on which he had been
sitting, and whistling to Nails, now a very ancient and preternaturally wise
dog, set off for a walk. He had mooned along some little way, with his hands in
his pockets and his eyes on the ground, reflecting on the unpleasant fate in
store for him as an articled clerk, continually under the glance of Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s roving eye, when suddenly he became aware that two ladies were
standing on the edge of the cliff within a dozen yards of him. He would have
turned and fled, for Jeremy had a marked dislike to ladies&rsquo; society, and
a strong opinion, which, however, he never expressed, that women were the root
of all evil; but, thinking that he had been seen, he feared that retreat would
appear rude. In one of the young ladies, for they were young, he recognised
Miss Florence Ceswick, who to all appearance had not changed in the least
since, some years ago, she came with her aunt to call on Dorothy. There was the
same brown hair, curling as profusely as ever, the same keen brown eyes and
ripe lips, the same small features and resolute expression of face. Her square
figure had indeed developed a little. In her tight-fitting dress it looked
almost handsome, and somehow its very squareness, that most women would have
considered a defect, contributed to the air of power and unchanging purpose
that would have made Florence Ceswick remarkable among a hundred handsomer
women.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; said Florence, in her sharp manner. &ldquo;You
looked as though you were walking in your sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before Jeremy could find a reply to this remark, the other young lady, who had
been looking intently over the edge of the cliff, turned round and struck him
dumb. In his limited experience he had never seen such a beautiful woman
before.
</p>

<p>
She was a head and shoulders taller than her sister, so tall indeed that only
her own natural grace could save her from looking awkward. Like her sister she
was a brunette, only of a much more pronounced type. Her waving hair was black,
and so were her beautiful eyes and the long lashes that curled over them. The
complexion was a clear olive, the lips were like coral, and the teeth small and
regular. Every advantage that Nature can lavish on a woman she had endowed her
with in abundance, including radiant health and spirits. To these charms must
be added that sweet and kindly look which sometimes finds a home on the faces
of good women, a soft voice, a quick intelligence, and an utter absence of
conceit or self-consciousness, and the reader will get some idea of what Eva
Ceswick was like in the first flush of her beauty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me introduce my sister Eva, Mr. Jones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Jones was for the moment paralysed; he could not even take off his hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence, presently, &ldquo;she is not Medusa; there
is no need for you to turn into stone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This woke him up&mdash;indeed, Florence had an ugly trick of waking people up
occasionally&mdash;and he took off his hat, which was as usual a dirty one, and
muttered something inaudible. As for Eva, she blushed, and with ready wit said
that Mr. Jones was no doubt astonished at the filthy state of her dress (as a
matter of fact, Jeremy could not have sworn that she had one on at all, much
less to its condition). &ldquo;The fact is,&rdquo; she went on, &ldquo;I have
been lying flat on the grass and looking over the edge of the cliff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What at?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the bones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The spot on which they were standing was part of the ancient graveyard of
Titheburgh Abbey, and as the sea encroached year by year, multitudes of the
bones of the long dead inhabitants of Kesterwick were washed out of their quiet
graves and strewed upon the beach and unequal surfaces of the cliff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; she said, kneeling down, an example that he followed. About
six feet below them, which was the depth at which the corpses had originally
been laid, could be seen fragments of lead and rotting wood projecting from the
surface of the cliff, and, what was a more ghastly sight, eight inches or more
of the leg-bones of a man, off which the feet had been washed away. On a ledge
in the sandy cliff, about twenty-five feet from the top and sixty or so from
the bottom, there lay quite a collection of human remains of all sorts and
sizes, conspicuous among them being the bones which had composed the feet that
belonged to the projecting shanks.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it dreadful?&rdquo; said Eva, gazing down with a species of
fascination; &ldquo;just fancy coming to that! Look at that little baby&rsquo;s
skull just by the big one. Perhaps that is the mother&rsquo;s. And oh, what is
that buried in the sand?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As much of the object to which she pointed at was visible looked like an old
cannon-ball, but Jeremy soon came to a different conclusion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a bit of a lead coffin,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, I should like to get down there and find out what is in it.
Can&rsquo;t you get down?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy shook his head. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve done it as a boy,&rdquo; he said,
&ldquo;when I was very light; but it is no good my trying now: the sand would
give with me, and I should go to the bottom.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was willing to do most things to oblige this lovely creature, but Jeremy was
above all things practical, and did not see the use of breaking his neck for
nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;you certainly are rather heavy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fifteen stone,&rdquo; he said, mournfully.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I am not ten; I think I could get down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You&rsquo;d better not try without a rope.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then their conversation was interrupted by Florence&rsquo;s clear voice:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;When you two people have quite finished staring at those disgusting
bones, perhaps, Eva, you will come home to lunch. If you only knew how silly
you look, sprawling there like two Turks going to be bastinadoed, perhaps you
would get up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was too much for Eva; she got up at once, and Jeremy followed suit.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why could you not let us examine our bones in peace, Florence?&rdquo;
said her sister, jokingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because you are really too idiotic. You see, Mr. Jones, anything that is
old and fusty, and has to do with old fogies who are dead and gone centuries
ago, has the greatest charms for my sister. She would like to go home and make
stories about those bones: whose they were, and what they did, and all the rest
of it. She calls it imagination; I call it fudge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva flushed up, but said nothing; evidently she was not accustomed to answer
her elder sister, and presently they parted to go their separate ways.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a great oaf that Jeremy is!&rdquo; said Florence to her sister on
their homeward way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not think him an oaf at all,&rdquo; she replied, warmly; &ldquo;I
thought him very nice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence shrugged her square shoulders. &ldquo;Well, of course, if you like a
giant with as much brain as an owl, there is nothing more to be said. You
should see Ernest; he is nice, if you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You seem very fond of Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;and I hope that when he comes
you won&rsquo;t poach on my manor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You need not be afraid,&rdquo; answered Eva, smiling; &ldquo;I promise
to leave your Ernest alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then that is a bargain,&rdquo; said Florence, sharply. &ldquo;Mind that
you keep to your word.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap06"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
JEREMY FALLS IN LOVE</h2>

<p>
Jeremy, for the first time for some years, had no appetite for his dinner that
day, a phenomenon that filled Dorothy with alarm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Jeremy,&rdquo; she said afterwards, &ldquo;what can be the
matter with you? you had only one helping of beef and no pudding!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing at all,&rdquo; he replied sulkily; and the subject dropped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; said Jeremy presently, &ldquo;do you know Miss Eva
Ceswick?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have seen her twice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of her, Doll?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of her?&rdquo; replied that cautious young person.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she is beautiful as&mdash;as an angel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite poetical, I declare! What next? Have you seen her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course, else how should I know she was beautiful?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, no wonder you had only once of beef!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy coloured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going to call there this afternoon; would you like to come?&rdquo;
went on his sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better and better; it will be the first call I ever remember your having
paid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t think she will mind, Doll?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should she mind? Most people don&rsquo;t mind being called on, even
if they have a pretty face.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty face! She is pretty all over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, a pretty all over. I start at three; don&rsquo;t be
late.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thereupon Jeremy went off to beautify himself for the occasion, and his sister
gazed at his departing form with the puzzled expression that had distinguished
her as a child.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He&rsquo;s going to fall in love with her,&rdquo; she said to herself,
&ldquo;and no wonder; any man would: she is &lsquo;pretty all over,&rsquo; as
he said, and what more does a man look at? I wish that <i>she</i> would fall in
love with him <i>before Ernest comes home;</i>&rdquo; and she sighed.
</p>

<p>
At a quarter to three Jeremy reappeared, looking particularly huge in a black
coat and his Sunday trousers. When they reached the cottage where Miss Ceswick
lived with her nieces, they were destined to meet with a disappointment, for
neither of the young ladies was at home. Miss Ceswick, however, was there, and
received them very cordially.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that you have come to see my newly imported niece,&rdquo; she
said; &ldquo;in fact, I am sure that you have, Mr. Jeremy, because you never
came to call upon me in your life. Ah, it is wonderful how young men will
change their habits to please a pair of bright eyes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy blushed painfully at this sally, but Dorothy came to his rescue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has Miss Eva come to live with you for good?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think so. You see, my dear, between you and me, her aunt in
London, with whom she was living, has got a family of daughters, who have
recently come out. Eva has been kept back as long as possible, but now that she
is twenty it was impossible to keep her back any more. But then, on the other
hand, it was felt&mdash;at least I think that it was felt&mdash;that to
continue to bring Eva out with her cousins would be to quite ruin their chance
of settling in life, because when <i>she</i> was in the room, no man could be
got to look at <i>them</i>. And so, you see, Eva has been sent down here as a
penalty for being so handsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Most of us would be glad to undergo heavier penalties than that if we
could only be guilty of the crime,&rdquo; said Dorothy, a little sadly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear, I daresay you think so,&rdquo; answered the old
lady. &ldquo;Every young woman longs to be beautiful and get the admiration of
men, but are they any the happier for it? I doubt it. Very often that
admiration brings endless troubles in its train, and perhaps in the end wrecks
the happiness of the woman herself and of others who are mixed up with her. I
was once a beautiful woman, my dear&mdash;I am old enough to say it
now&mdash;and I can tell you that I believe that Providence cannot do a more
unkind thing to a woman than to give her striking beauty, unless it gives with
it great strength of mind. A weak-minded beauty is the most unfortunate of her
sex. Her very attractions, which are sure to draw the secret enmity of other
women on to her, are a source of difficulty to herself, because they bring her
lovers with whom she cannot deal. Sometimes the end of such a woman is sad
enough. I have seen it happen several times, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Often in after-life, and in circumstances that had not then arisen, did Dorothy
think of old Miss Ceswick&rsquo;s words, and acknowledge their truth; but at
this time they did not convince her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would give anything to be like your niece,&rdquo; she said bluntly,
&ldquo;and so would any other girl. Ask Florence, for instance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear, you think so now. Wait till another twenty years have
passed over your heads, and then if you are both alive see which of you is the
happiest. As for Florence, of course she would wish to be like Eva; of course
it is painful for her to have to go about with a girl beside whom she looks
like a little dowdy. I daresay that she would have been as glad if Eva had
stopped in London as her cousins were that she left it. Dear, dear! I hope they
won&rsquo;t quarrel. Florence&rsquo;s temper is dreadful when she
quarrels.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was a remark that Dorothy could not gainsay. She knew very well what
Florence&rsquo;s temper was like.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Mr. Jeremy,&rdquo; went on the old lady, &ldquo;all this must be
stupid talk for you to listen to; tell me, have you been rowing any more races
lately?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jeremy, &ldquo;I strained a muscle in my arm in the
&rsquo;Varsity Race, and it is not quite well yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And where is my dear Ernest?&rdquo; Like most women, of whatever age
they might be, Miss Ceswick adored Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is coming back on Monday week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, then he will be in time for the Smythes&rsquo; lawn tennis party. I
hear that they are going to give a dance after it. Do you dance, Mr.
Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy had to confess that he did not; indeed, as a matter of fact, no earthly
power had ever been able to drag him inside a ballroom in his life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is a pity; there are so few young men in these parts. Florence
counted them up the other day, and the proportion is one unmarried man, between
the ages of twenty and forty-five, to every nine women between eighteen and
thirty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then only one girl in every nine can get married,&rdquo; put in Dorothy,
whose mind had a trick of following things to their conclusions.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what becomes of the other eight?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose that they all grow into old maids like myself,&rdquo; answered
Miss Ceswick.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy, again following the matter to its conclusion, reflected that in
fifteen years or so there would, at the present rate of progression, be at
least twenty-five old maids within a radius of three miles round Kesterwick.
And, much oppressed by this thought, she rose to take her leave.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know who won&rsquo;t be left without a husband, unless men are greater
stupids than I take them for&mdash;eh, Jeremy?&rdquo; said the kindly old lady,
giving Dorothy a kiss.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you mean me,&rdquo; answered Dorothy bluntly, with a slightly
heightened colour, &ldquo;I am not so vain as to think that anybody would care
for an undersized creature whose only accomplishment is housekeeping; and I am
sure it is not for anybody that I should care either.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my dear, there are still a few men of sense in the world, who would
rather get a <i>good</i> woman as companion than a pretty face. Good-bye, my
dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though Jeremy was on this occasion disappointed of seeing Eva, on the following
morning he was so fortunate as to meet her and her sister walking on the beach.
But when he got into her gracious presence he found somehow that he had very
little to say; and the walk would, to tell the truth, have been rather dull, if
it had not occasionally been enlivened by flashes of Florence&rsquo;s caustic
wit.
</p>

<p>
On the next day, however, he returned to the charge with several hundredweight
of the roots of a certain flower which Eva had expressed a desire to possess.
And so it went on till at last his shyness wore off a little, and they grew
very good friends.
</p>

<p>
Of course all this did not escape Florence&rsquo;s sharp eyes, and one day,
just after Jeremy had paid her sister a lumbering compliment and departed, she
summarised her observations thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That moon-calf is falling in love with you, Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Florence! and why should you call him a moon-calf? It is not
nice to talk of people so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, if you can find a better definition, I am willing to adopt
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that he is an honest gentleman-like boy; and even if he were
falling in love with me, I do not think there would be anything to be ashamed
of&mdash;there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, what a fuss we are in! Do you know, I shall soon begin to think
that you are falling in love with the &lsquo;honest gentleman-like
boy&rsquo;&mdash;yes, that is a better title than moon-calf, though not so
nervous.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Eva marched off in a huff.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Jeremy, and how are you getting on with the beautiful Eva?&rdquo;
asked Dorothy that same day.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Doll,&rdquo; replied Jeremy, whose general appearance was that of
a man plunged into the depths of misery, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t laugh at a fellow;
if you only knew what I feel&mdash;inside, you know&mdash;you
wouldn&rsquo;t&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What! are you not well? have some brandy?&rdquo; suggested his sister,
in genuine alarm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be an idiot, Doll; it isn&rsquo;t my stomach, it&rsquo;s
here;&rdquo; and he knocked his right lung, under the impression that he was
indicating the position of his heart.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what do you feel, Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Feel!&rdquo; he answered with a groan; &ldquo;what don&rsquo;t I feel?
When I am away from her I feel a sort of sinking, just like one does when one
has to go without one&rsquo;s dinner, only it&rsquo;s always there. When she
looks at me I go hot and cold all over, and when she smiles it&rsquo;s just as
though one had killed a couple of woodcocks right and left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good gracious, Jeremy!&rdquo; interposed his sister, who was beginning
to think he had gone off his head; &ldquo;and what happens if she doesn&rsquo;t
smile?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, then,&rdquo; he replied, sadly, &ldquo;it&rsquo;s as though one had
missed them both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Though his similes were peculiar, it was clear to his sister that the feeling
he meant to convey was genuine enough.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you really fond of this girl, Jeremy dear?&rdquo; she said gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Doll, you know, I suppose I am.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then why don&rsquo;t you ask her to marry you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To marry <i>me!</i> Why, I am not fit to clean her shoes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;An honest gentleman is fit for any woman, Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I haven&rsquo;t got anything to support her on even if she said yes,
which she wouldn&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You may get that in time. Remember, Jeremy, she is a very lovely woman,
and soon she is sure to find other lovers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy groaned.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if once you had secured her affection, and she is a good woman, as I
think she is, that would not matter, though you might not be able to marry for
some years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what am I to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should tell her that you loved her, and ask her, if she could care for
you&mdash;to wait for you awhile.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy whistled meditatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll ask Ernest about it when he comes back on Monday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I were you I should act for myself in that matter,&rdquo; she said
quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No good being in a hurry; I haven&rsquo;t known her a
fortnight&mdash;I&rsquo;ll ask Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you will regret it,&rdquo; Dorothy answered, almost passionately,
and rising, left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what did she mean by that?&rdquo; reflected her brother aloud;
&ldquo;she always is so deuced queer when Ernest is concerned.&rdquo; But his
inner consciousness returned no satisfactory answer, so with a sigh the
lovelorn Jeremy took up his hat and walked.
</p>

<p>
On Sunday, that was the day following his talk with Dorothy, he saw Eva again
in church, where she looked, he thought, more like an angel than ever, and was
quite as inaccessible. In the churchyard he did, it is true, manage to get a
word or two with her, but nothing more, for the sermon had been long, and
Florence was hungry, and hurried her sister home to lunch.
</p>

<p>
And then, at last, came Monday, the long-expected day of Ernest&rsquo;s
arrival.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap07"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/>
ERNEST IS INDISCREET</h2>

<p>
Kesterwick is a primitive place, and has no railway station nearer than
Raffham, four miles off. Ernest was expected by the midday train, and Dorothy
and her brother went to meet him.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the station the train was just in sight, and Dorothy got down
to await its arrival. Presently it snorted up composedly&mdash;trains do not hurry
themselves on the single lines in the Eastern counties&mdash;and in due course
deposited Ernest and his portmanteau.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, Doll! so you have come to meet me. How are you, old girl?&rdquo;
and he embraced her on the platform.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shouldn&rsquo;t, Ernest: I am too big to be kissed like a little
girl, and in public too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Big&mdash;h&rsquo;m! Miss five feet nothing, and as for the public, I
don&rsquo;t see any.&rdquo; The train had gone on, and the solitary porter had
vanished with the portmanteau.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, there is no need for you to laugh at me for being small; it is not
everybody who can be a May-pole, like you, or as broad as he is long, like
Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
An unearthly view halloo from this last-named personage, who had caught sight
of Ernest through the door of the booking-office, put a stop to further
controversy, and presently all three were driving back, each talking at the top
of his or her voice.
</p>

<p>
At the door of Dum&rsquo;s Ness they found Mr. Cardus apparently gazing
abstractedly at the ocean, but in reality waiting to greet Ernest, to whom of
late years he had grown greatly attached, though his reserve seldom allowed him
to show it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, uncle, how are you? You look pretty fresh,&rdquo; sang out that
young gentleman before the cart had fairly come to a standstill.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, thank you, Ernest. I need not ask how you are. I am glad to
see you back. You have come at a lucky moment, too, for the &lsquo;Batemania
Wallisii&rsquo; is in flower, and the &lsquo;Grammatophyllum speciosum&rsquo;
too. The last is splendid.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; said Ernest, deeply interested, for he had much of his
uncle&rsquo;s love for orchids, &ldquo;let&rsquo;s go and see them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better have some dinner first; you must be hungry. The orchids will
keep, but the dinner won&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was curious to see what a ray of light this lad brought with him into that
rather gloomy household. Everybody began to laugh as soon as he was inside the
doors. Even Grice of the beady eyes laughed when he feigned to be
thunder-struck at the newly developed beauty of her person, and mad old
Atterleigh&rsquo;s contorted features lit up with something like a smile of
recognition when Ernest seized his hand and worked it like a pump-handle,
roaring out his congratulations on the jollity of his looks. He was a bonny
lad, the sight of whom was good for sore eyes.
</p>

<p>
After dinner he went with his uncle, and spent half an hour in going round the
orchid-houses with him and Sampson the gardener. The latter was not behind the
rest of the household in his appreciation of &ldquo;Meester&rdquo; Ernest.
&ldquo;&rsquo;Twasn&rsquo;t many lads,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;that knew an
&lsquo;Odontoglossum&rsquo; from a &lsquo;Sobralia,&rsquo;&rdquo; but Ernest
did, and, what was more, knew whether it was well grown or not. Sampson
appreciated a man who could discriminate orchids, and set his preference for
Ernest down to that cause. The dour-visaged old Scotchman did not like to own
that what really charmed him was the lad&rsquo;s open-handed, openhearted
manner, to say nothing of his ready sympathy and honest eyes.
</p>

<p>
While they were still engaged in admiring the lovely bloom of the
Grammatophyllum, Mr. Cardus saw Mr. de Talor come into his office, which, it
may be remembered, was connected with the orchid blooming-house by a glass
door. Ernest was much interested in observing the curious change that this
man&rsquo;s appearance produced in his uncle. As a peaceful cat, dozing on a
warm stone in summer, becomes suddenly changed into a thing of bristling
wickedness and fury by the vision of the most inoffensive dog, so did the
placid, bald-headed old gentleman, glowing with innocent pleasure at his
horticultural masterpiece, commence to glow with very different emotions at the
sight of the pompous De Talor. The ruling passion of his life asserted its sway
in a moment, and his whole face changed; the upper lip began to quiver, the
roving eyes glittered with a dangerous light; and then a mask seemed to gather
over the features, which grew hard and almost inscrutable. It was an
interesting transformation.
</p>

<p>
Although they could see De Talor, he could not see them; so for a minute they
enjoyed an undisturbed period of observation.
</p>

<p>
The visitor walked round the room, and, casting a look of contempt at the
flowers in the blooming-house, stopped at Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s desk, and glanced
at the papers lying on it. Finding apparently nothing to interest him he
retired to the window, and, putting his thumbs in the arm-holes of his
waistcoat, amused himself by staring out of it. There was something so
intensely vulgar and insolent in his appearance as he stood thus, that Ernest
could not help laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, with a look of suppressed malignity, half to
himself and half to Ernest, &ldquo;I have really got a hold of you at last, and
you may look out, my friend.&rdquo; Then he went in, and as he left the
blooming-house Ernest heard him greet his visitor in that suave manner, with
just a touch of deference in it, that he knew so well how to assume, and De
Talor&rsquo;s reply of &ldquo;&rsquo;Ow do, Cardus? &rsquo;ow&rsquo;s the
business getting on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Outside the glass-houses Ernest found Jeremy waiting for him. It had for years
been an understood thing that the latter was not to enter them. There was no
particular reason why he should not; it was merely one of those signs of Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s disfavour that caused Jeremy&rsquo;s pride such bitter injury.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you going to do, old fellow?&rdquo; he asked of Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I want to go down and see Florence Ceswick, but I suppose you
won&rsquo;t care to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, I&rsquo;ll come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deuce you will! well, I never! I say, Doll,&rdquo; he sang out to
that young lady as she appeared upon the scene, &ldquo;what has happened to
Jeremy&mdash;he&rsquo;s coming out calling?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I fancy he&rsquo;s got an attraction,&rdquo; said Miss Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, old fellow, you haven&rsquo;t been cutting me out with Florence,
have you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure it would be no great loss if he had,&rdquo; put in Dorothy,
with an impatient little stamp of the foot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You be quiet, Doll. I&rsquo;m very fond of Florence, she&rsquo;s so
clever, and nice-looking, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If being clever means being able to say spiteful things, and having a
temper like&mdash;like a fiend, she is certainly clever enough; and as for her
looks, they are a matter of taste&mdash;not that it is for <i>me</i> to talk
about good looks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, how humble we are, Doll! dust on our head and sackcloth on our back,
and how our blue eyes flash!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be quiet, Ernest, or I shall get angry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, don&rsquo;t do that; leave that to people with a temper
&lsquo;like&mdash;like a fiend,&rsquo; you know. There, there, don&rsquo;t get
cross, Dolly; let&rsquo;s kiss and be friends.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I won&rsquo;t kiss you, and I won&rsquo;t be friends, and you may walk
by yourselves;&rdquo; and before anybody could stop her she was gone.
</p>

<p>
Ernest whistled softly, reflecting that Dorothy was not good at standing chaff.
Then, after waiting awhile, he and Jeremy started to pay their call.
</p>

<p>
But they were destined to be unfortunate. Eva, whom Ernest had never seen, and
of whom he had heard nothing beyond that she was
&ldquo;good-looking&rdquo;&mdash;for Jeremy, notwithstanding his expressed
intention of consulting him, could not make up his mind to broach the
subject&mdash;was in bed with a bad headache, and Florence had gone out to
spend the afternoon with a friend. The old lady was at home, however, and
received them both warmly, more especially her favourite Ernest, whom she
kissed affectionately.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am lucky,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;in having two nieces, or I should
never see anything of young gentlemen like you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think,&rdquo; said Ernest, audaciously, &ldquo;that old ladies are
much pleasanter to talk to than young ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, Master Ernest! then why did you look so blank when I told you
that my young ladies were not visible?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I regretted,&rdquo; replied that young gentleman, who was not
often at a loss, &ldquo;having lost an opportunity of confirming my
views.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will put the question again when they are present to take their own
part,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
When their call was over, Ernest and Jeremy separated, Jeremy to return home,
and Ernest to go and see his old master, Mr. Halford, with whom he stopped to
tea. It was past seven on one of the most beautiful evenings in July when he
set out on his homeward path. There were two ways of reaching Dum&rsquo;s Ness,
either by the road that ran along the cliff, or by walking on the shingle of
the beach. He chose the latter, and had reached the spot where Titheburgh Abbey
frowned at its enemy, the advancing sea, when he suddenly became aware of a
young lady wearing a shady hat and swinging a walking-stick, in whom he
recognised Florence Ceswick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Ernest?&rdquo; she said, coolly, but with a slight flush
upon her olive skin, which betrayed that she was not quite so cool as she
looked; &ldquo;what are you dreaming about? I have seen you coming for the last
two hundred yards, but you never saw me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was dreaming of you, of course, Florence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, indeed!&rdquo; she answered dryly; &ldquo;I thought perhaps that Eva
had got over her headache&mdash;her headaches do go in the most wonderful
way&mdash;and that you had seen her, and were dreaming of <i>her.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why should I dream of her, even if I had seen her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For the reason that men do dream of women&mdash;because she is
handsome.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is she better-looking than you, then, Florence?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better-looking, indeed! I am not good-looking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Florence! you are very good-looking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She stopped, for he had turned and was walking with her, and laid her hand
lightly on his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you really think so?&rdquo; she said, gazing full into his dark eyes.
&ldquo;I am glad you think so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were quite alone in the summer twilight; there was not a single soul to be
seen on the beach, or on the cliffs above it. Her touch and the earnestness of
her manner thrilled him; the beauty and the quiet of the evening, the sweet
freshness of the air, the murmur of the falling waves, the fading purples in
the sky, all these things thrilled him too. Her face looked very handsome in
its own stern way, as she gazed at him so earnestly; and, remember, he was only
twenty-one. He bent his dark head towards her very slowly, to give her an
opportunity of escaping if she wished; but she made no sign, and in another
moment he had kissed her trembling lips.
</p>

<p>
It was a foolish act, for he was not in love with Florence, and he had scarcely
done it before his better sense told him that it was foolish. But it was done,
and who can recall a kiss?
</p>

<p>
He saw the olive face grow pale, and for a moment she raised her arm as though
to fling it about his neck, but next second she started back from him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Did you mean that,&rdquo; she said wildly, &ldquo;or are you playing
with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked alarmed, as well he might; the young lady&rsquo;s aspect at the
moment was not reassuring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean it?&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;O yes, I meant it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean, Ernest,&rdquo; and again she laid her hand upon his arm and
looked into his eyes, &ldquo;did you mean that you loved me, as&mdash;for now I
am not ashamed to tell you&mdash;I love you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest felt that this was getting awful. To kiss a young woman was one
thing&mdash;he had done that before&mdash;but such an outburst as this was more
than he had bargained for. Gratifying as it was to him to learn that he
possessed Florence&rsquo;s affection, he would at that moment have given
something to be without it. He hesitated a little.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How serious you are!&rdquo; he said at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am. I have been serious for some
time. Probably you know enough of me to be aware that I am not a woman to be
played with. I hope that you are serious too; if you are not, it may be the
worse for us both;&rdquo; and she flung his arm from her as though it had stung
her.
</p>

<p>
Ernest turned cold all over, and realised that the position was positively
gruesome. What to say or do he did not know; so he stood silent, and, as it
happened, silence served his turn better than speech.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, Ernest, I have startled you. It is&mdash;it is because I love
you. When you kissed me just now, everything that is beautiful in the world
seemed to pass before my eyes, and for a moment I heard such music as they play
in heaven. You don&rsquo;t understand me yet, Ernest&mdash;I am fierce, I
know&mdash;but sometimes I think that my heart is deep as the sea, and I can
love with ten times the strength of the shallow women round me; and as I can
love, so I can hate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was not reassuring intelligence to Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a strange girl,&rdquo; he said feebly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, with a smile. &ldquo;I know I am strange; but
while I am with you I feel so good, and when you are away all my life is a
void, in which bitter thoughts flit about like bats. But there, good-night. I
shall see you at the Smythes&rsquo; dance to-morrow, shall I not? You will
dance with me, will you not? And you must not dance with Eva, remember&mdash;at
least not too much&mdash;or I shall get jealous, and that will be bad for us
both. And now goodnight, my dear, good-night;&rdquo; and again she put up her
face to be kissed.
</p>

<p>
He kissed it&mdash;he had no alternative&mdash;and she left him swiftly. He
watched her retreating form till it vanished in the shadows, and then he sat
down upon a stone, wiped his forehead, and <i>whistled.</i> Well might he whistle!

<h2><a name="chap08"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
A GARDEN IDYL</h2>

<p>
Ernest did not sleep well that night: the scene of the evening haunted his
dreams, and he awoke with a sense of oppression that impartially follows on the
heels of misfortune, folly, and lobster-salad. Nor did the broad light of the
summer day disperse his sorrows; indeed, it only served to define them more
clearly. Ernest was a very inexperienced youth, but, inexperienced as he was,
he could not but recognise that he had let himself in for an awkward business.
He was not in the smallest degree in love with Florence Ceswick; indeed, his
predominant feeling towards her was one of fear. She was, as he had said, so
terribly in earnest. In short, though she was barely a year older than himself,
she was a woman possessed of a strength of purpose and a rigidity of will that
few of her sex ever attain to at any period of their lives. This he had guessed
long ago; but what he had not guessed was that all the tide of her life set so
strongly towards himself. That unlucky kiss, as it were, had shot the bolt of
the sluice-gates, and now he was in a fair way to be overwhelmed by the rush of
the waters. What course of action he had best take with her now it was beyond
his powers to decide. He thought of taking Dorothy into his confidence and
asking her advice, but instinctively he shrank from doing so. Then he thought
of Jeremy, only, however, to reject the idea. What would Jeremy know of such
things? He little guessed that Jeremy was swelling with a secret of his own, of
which he was too shy to deliver himself. It seemed to Ernest, the more he
considered the matter, that there was only one safe course for him to follow,
and that was to run away. It would be ignominious, it is true, but at any rate
Florence could not run after him. He had made arrangements to meet a friend,
and go for a tour with him in France towards the end of the month of August, or
about five weeks from the present date. These arrangements he now determined to
modify: he would go for his tour at once.
</p>

<p>
Partially comforted by these reflections, he dressed himself that evening for
the dance at the Smythes&rsquo;, where he was to meet Florence, who, however,
he gratefully reflected, could not expect him to kiss her there. The dance was
to follow a lawn-tennis party, to which Dorothy, accompanied by Jeremy, had
already gone, Ernest having, for reasons best known to himself, declined to go
to the lawn-tennis, preferring to follow them to the dance.
</p>

<p>
When he entered the ballroom at the Smythes&rsquo;, the first quadrille was in
progress. Making his way up the room, Ernest soon came upon Florence Ceswick,
who was sitting with Dorothy, while in the background loomed Jeremy&rsquo;s
gigantic form. Both the girls appeared to be waiting for him, for on his
approach Florence, by a movement of her dress, and an almost imperceptible
motion of her hand, at once made room for him on the bench beside her, and
invited him to sit down. He did so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are late,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;why did you not come to the
lawn-tennis?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought that our party was sufficiently represented,&rdquo; he
answered, lamely, nodding towards Jeremy and his sister. &ldquo;Why are you not
dancing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because nobody asked me,&rdquo; she said, sharply; &ldquo;and besides, I
was waiting for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jeremy,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;here is Florence says that you
didn&rsquo;t ask her to dance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk humbug, Ernest; you know I don&rsquo;t dance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed,&rdquo; put in Dorothy, &ldquo;it is easy to see that; I
never saw anybody look so miserable as you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Or so big,&rdquo; said Florence, consolingly.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy shrank back into his corner and tried to look smaller. His sister was
right, a dance was untold misery to him. The quadrille had ceased by now, and
presently the band struck up a waltz, which Ernest danced with Florence. They
both waltzed well, and Ernest kept going as much as possible, perhaps in order
to give no opportunity for conversation. At any rate no allusion was made to
the events of the previous evening.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are your aunt and sister, Florence?&rdquo; he asked, as he led her
back to her seat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are coming presently,&rdquo; she answered, shortly.
</p>

<p>
The next dance was a galop, and this he danced with Dorothy, whose slim figure
looked, in the white muslin dress she wore, more like that of a child than a
grown woman. But child or woman, her general appearance was singularly pleasing
and attractive. Ernest thought that he had never seen the quaint, puckered
little face, with the two steady blue eyes in it, look so attractive. Not that
it was pretty&mdash;it was not, but it was a face with a great deal of thought
in it, and moreover it was a face through which the goodness of its owner
seemed to shine like the light through a lamp.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look so nice to-night, Doll,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
She flushed with pleasure, and answered simply, &ldquo;I am glad you think
so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I do think so; you are really pretty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Ernest! Can&rsquo;t you find some other butt to practise your
compliments on? What is the good of wasting them on me? I am going to sit
down.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Doll, I don&rsquo;t know what has come to you lately, you have
grown so cross.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sighed as she answered, gently:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No more do I, Ernest. I did not mean to speak crossly, but you should
not make fun of me. Ah, here come Miss Ceswick and Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They had rejoined Florence and Jeremy. The two ladies were seated, while Ernest
and Jeremy were standing, the former in front of them, the latter against the
wall behind, for they were gathered at the topmost end of the long room. At
Dorothy&rsquo;s announcement both the lads bent forward to look down the room,
and both the women fixed their eyes on Ernest&rsquo;s face anxiously,
expectantly, something as a criminal fixes his eyes on the foreman of a jury
who is about to pronounce words that will one way or another affect all his
life.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t see them,&rdquo; said Ernest carelessly. &ldquo;O, here
they come. <i>By George!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus03"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig03.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;<i>By George!</i>&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Whatever these two women were looking for in his face, they had found it, and,
to all appearance, it pleased them very little. Dorothy turned pale, and leaned
back with a faint smile of resignation; she had expected it, that smile seemed
to say; but the blood flamed like a danger-flag into Florence&rsquo;s haughty
features&mdash;there was no resignation there. And meanwhile Ernest was staring
down the room, quite unaware of the little comedy that was going on around him;
so was Jeremy, and so was every other man who was there to stare.
</p>

<p>
And this was what they were staring at. Up the centre of the long room walked,
or rather swept, Miss Ceswick, for even at her advanced age she moved like a
queen, and at any other time her appearance would in itself have been
sufficient to excite remark. But people were not looking at Miss Ceswick, but
rather at the radiant creature who accompanied her, and whose stature dwarfed
her, tall as she was. Eva Ceswick&mdash;for it was she&mdash;was dressed in
white <i>soie de Chine,</i> in the bosom of which was fixed a single rose. The
dress was cut low, and her splendid neck and arms were entirely without
ornament. In the masses of dark hair, which was coiled like a coronet round her
head, there glistened a diamond star. Simple as was her costume, there was a
grandeur about it that struck the whole room; but in truth it sprang from the
almost perfect beauty of the woman who wore it. Any dress would have looked
beautiful upon that noble form, that towered so high, and yet seemed to float
up the room with the grace of a swan and sway like a willow in the wind. But
her loveliness did not end there. From those dark eyes there shone a light that
few men could look upon and forget, and yet there was nothing bold about it. It
was like the light of a star.
</p>

<p>
On she came, her lips half-parted, seemingly unconscious of the admiration she
was attracting, eclipsing all other women as she passed, and making their
beauty, that before had seemed bright enough, look poor and mean beside her
own. It took but a few seconds, ten perhaps, for her to walk up the room, and
yet to Ernest it seemed long before her eyes met his own, and something passed
from them into his heart that remained there all his life.
</p>

<p>
His gaze made her blush a little, it was so unmistakable. She guessed who he
was, and passed him with a little inclination of her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, here we are at last,&rdquo; she said, addressing her sister in her
pure musical voice. &ldquo;What do you think? something went wrong with the
wheel of the fly, and we had to stop to get it mended!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; answered Florence; &ldquo;I thought that perhaps you came
late in order to make a more effective entry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; said her aunt, reprovingly, &ldquo;you should not say
such things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence did not answer, but put her lace handkerchief to her lip. She had
bitten it till the blood ran.
</p>

<p>
By this time Ernest had recovered himself. He saw several young fellows bearing
down upon them, and knew what they were after.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Ceswick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;will you introduce me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No sooner said than done, and at that moment the band began to play a waltz. In
five seconds more Eva was floating down the room upon his arm, and the
advancing young gentlemen were left lamenting, and, if the truth must be told,
anathematising &ldquo;that puppy Kershaw&rdquo; beneath their breath.
</p>

<p>
There was a spirit in her feet; she danced divinely. Lightly leaning on his
arm, they swept round the room, the incarnation of youthful strength and
beauty, and, as they passed, even sour old Lady Asteigh lowered her ancient
nose an inch or more, and deigned to ask who that handsome young man dancing
with the &ldquo;tall girl&rdquo; was. Presently they halted, and Ernest
observed a more than usually intrepid man coming towards them, with the design,
no doubt, of obtaining an introduction and the promise of dances. But again he
was equal to the occasion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you a card?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you allow me to put my name down for another dance? I think that
our steps suit.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we get on nicely. Here it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest took it. The young man had arrived now, and was hovering round and
glowering. Ernest nodded to him cheerfully, and &ldquo;put his name&rdquo; very
much down&mdash;indeed, for no less than three dances and an extra.
</p>

<p>
Eva opened her eyes a little, but she said nothing; their steps suited so very
well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;May I ask you, Kershaw&mdash;&rdquo; began his would-be rival.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, certainly,&rdquo; answered Ernest benignly, &ldquo;I will be with you
presently;&rdquo; and they floated off again on the rising wave of the music.
</p>

<p>
When the dance ended, they stopped just by the spot where Miss Ceswick was
sitting. Florence and Dorothy were both dancing, but Jeremy, who did not dance,
was standing by her, looking as sulky as a bear with a sore head. Eva stretched
out her hand to him with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope that you are going to dance with me, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dance,&rdquo; he answered, curtly, and walked away.
</p>

<p>
She gazed after him wonderingly; his manner was decidedly rude.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not think that Mr. Jones is in a good temper,&rdquo; she said to
Ernest, with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, he is a queer fellow; going out always makes him cross,&rdquo; he
answered carelessly.
</p>

<p>
Then the gathering phalanx of would-be partners marched in and took possession,
and Ernest had to retire.
</p>

<p>
The ball was drawing to its close. The dancing-room, notwithstanding its open
windows, was intensely hot, and many of the dancers were strolling in the
gardens, among them Ernest and Eva. They had just danced their third waltz, in
which they had discovered that their steps suited better than ever.
</p>

<p>
Florence, Dorothy, and her brother were also walking all three together. It is
curious how people in misfortune cling to one another. They walked in silence;
they had nothing to say. Presently they caught sight of two tall figures
standing by a bush, on which was fixed a dying Chinese lantern. It is sometimes
unfortunate to be tall, it betrays one&rsquo;s identity; there was no mistaking
the two figures, though it was so dark. Instinctively the three halted. And
just then the expiring Chinese lantern did an unkind thing: it caught fire, and
threw a lurid light upon a very pretty little scene. Ernest was bending forward
towards Eva with all his soul in his expressive eyes, and begging for
something. She was blushing sweetly, and looking down at the rose in her bosom;
one hand, too, was raised, as though to unfasten it. The light for a moment was
so strong that Dorothy afterwards remembered noticing how long Eva&rsquo;s
curling black eyelashes looked against her cheek. In another second it had
flared out, and the darkness hid the sequel; but it may here be stated that
when Eva reappeared in the ballroom she had lost her rose.
</p>

<p>
Charming and idyllic as this <i>tableau très vivant</i> of youth and beauty,
obeying the primary law of nature, and making love to one another in a Garden
of Eden illumined with Chinese lanterns, undoubtedly was, it did not seem to
please any of the three spectators.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy actually forgot the presence of ladies, and went so far as to swear
aloud. Nor did they reprove him; probably it gave their feelings some vicarious
relief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that we had better be going home; it is late,&rdquo; said
Dorothy, after a pause. &ldquo;Jeremy, will you go and order the
carriage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy went.
</p>

<p>
Florence said nothing, but she took her fan in both her hands and bent it
slowly, so that the ivory sticks snapped one by one with a succession of sharp
reports. Then she threw it down, and set her heel upon it, and ground it into
the path. There was something inexpressibly cruel about the way in which she
crushed the pretty toy; the action seemed to be the appropriate and unconscious
outcome of some mental process, and it is an odd proof of the excitement under
which they were both labouring, that at the time the gentle-minded Dorothy saw
nothing strange about it. At that moment the two girls were nearer each other
than they had ever been before, or would ever be again; the common stroke of a
misfortune for a moment welded their opposite natures into one. At that moment,
too, they knew that they both loved the same man; before, they had guessed it,
and had not liked each other the better for it, but now that was forgotten.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think, Florence,&rdquo; said Dorothy, with a little tremor in her
voice, &ldquo;that we are &lsquo;out of the running,&rsquo; as Jeremy says.
Your sister is too beautiful for any woman to stand against her. He has fallen
in love with her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Florence, with a bitter laugh and a flash of her brown
eyes; &ldquo;his highness has thrown a handkerchief to a new favourite, and she
has lost no time in picking it up. We always used to call her &lsquo;the
sultana;&rsquo;&rdquo; and she laughed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps,&rdquo; suggested Dorothy, &ldquo;she only means to flirt with
him a little; I hoped that Jeremy&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Jeremy! what chance has Jeremy against him? Ernest would make more way
with a woman in two hours than Jeremy would in two years. We all love to be
taken by storm, my dear. Do not deceive yourself. Flirt with him! she will love
him wildly in a week. Who could help loving him?&rdquo; she added, with a
thrill of her rich voice.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy said nothing: she knew that it was true, and they walked a few steps in
silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dorothy, do you know what generally happens to favourites and
sultanas?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They come to a bad end; the other ladies of the harem murder them, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be frightened; I don&rsquo;t mean that we should murder my
dear sister. What I do mean is, that I think we might manage to depose her.
Will you help me if I find a plan?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy&rsquo;s better self had had time to assert itself by now; the influence
of the blow was over, and their natures were wide apart again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, certainly not,&rdquo; she answered. &ldquo;Ernest has a right to
choose for himself, and if your sister gets the better of us, it is the fortune
of war, that is all&mdash;though certainly the fight is not quite fair,&rdquo;
she added, as she thought of Eva&rsquo;s radiant loveliness.
</p>

<p>
Florence glanced at her contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have no spirit,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean to do!&rdquo; she answered, swinging round and facing her; &ldquo;I
mean to have my revenge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Florence, it is wicked to talk so! whom are you going to be revenged
on&mdash;Ernest? It is not his fault if &mdash;if you are fond of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is his fault; but whether it is his fault or not, he shall
suffer. Remember what I say, for it will come true; he shall suffer. Why should
I bear it all alone? But he shall not suffer so much as she. I told her that I
was fond of him, and she promised to leave him alone&mdash;do you hear
that?&mdash;and yet she is taking him away from me to gratify her
vanity&mdash;she, who can have anybody she likes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hush, Florence! Don&rsquo;t give way to your temper so, or you will be
overheard. Besides, I daresay that we are making a great deal out of nothing;
after all, she only gave him a rose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t care if we are overheard, and it is not nothing. I guessed
that it would be so, I knew that it would be so, and I know what is coming now.
Mark my words, within a month Ernest and my sweet sister will be sitting about
on the cliff with their arms around each other&rsquo;s necks. I have only to
shut my eyes, and I can see it. O, here is Jeremy! Is the carriage there,
Jeremy? That&rsquo;s right. Come on, Dorothy, let us go and say good-night and
be off. You will drop me at the cottage, won&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Half an hour later the fly that had brought Miss Ceswick and Eva came round,
and with it Ernest&rsquo;s dog-cart. But as Miss Ceswick was rather anxious
about the injured wheel, Ernest, as in duty bound, offered to see them safe
home, and, ordering the cart to follow, got into the fly without waiting for an
answer.
</p>

<p>
Of course Miss Ceswick went to sleep, but it is not probable that either Ernest
or Eva followed her example. Perhaps they were too tired to talk; perhaps they
were beginning to find out what a delightful companionship is to be found in
silence; perhaps his gentle pressure of the little white-gloved hand, that lay
unresisting in his own, was more eloquent than any speech.
</p>

<p>
Don&rsquo;t be shocked, my reader; you or I would have done the same, and
thought ourselves very lucky fellows!
</p>

<p>
At any rate, that drive was over all too soon.
</p>

<p>
Florence opened the door for them; she had told the servant to go to bed.
</p>

<p>
When Eva reached the door of her room she turned round to say good-night to her
sister; but the latter, instead of contenting herself with a nod, as was her
custom, came and kissed her on the face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I congratulate you on your dress and on your conquest,&rdquo; and again
she kissed her and was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not like Florence to be so kind,&rdquo; reflected her younger
sister. &ldquo;I can&rsquo;t remember when she kissed me last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva did not know that as there are some kisses that declare peace, and set the
seal on love, there are others that announce war, and proclaim the hour of
vengeance or treachery. Judas kissed his Master when he betrayed Him.

<h2><a name="chap09"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>
EVA FINDS SOMETHING</h2>

<p>
When Ernest woke on the morning after the ball it was ten o&rsquo;clock, and he
had a severe headache. This&mdash;the headache&mdash;was his first impression,
but presently his eye fell upon a withering red rose that lay upon the
dressing-table, and he smiled. Then followed reflections, those confounded
reflections that always dog the heels of everything pleasant in life, and he
ceased to smile.
</p>

<p>
In the end he yawned and got up. When he reached the sitting-room, which looked
cool and pleasant in contrast to the hot July sunshine that beat upon the
little patch of bare turf in front of the house, and the glittering sea beyond,
he found that the others had done their breakfast. Jeremy had gone out, but his
sister was there, looking a little pale, no doubt from the late hours of the
previous night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, Doll!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, Ernest,&rdquo; she answered, rather coldly. &ldquo;I have
been keeping your tea as warm as I can, but I&rsquo;m afraid it is getting
cold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a good Samaritan, Doll. I&rsquo;ve got such a head! perhaps the
tea will make it better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She smiled as she gave it to him; had she spoken what was in her mind, she
would have answered that she had &ldquo;such a heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He drank the tea, and apparently felt better for it, for presently he asked
her, in comparatively cheerful tones, how she liked the dance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, very well, thank you, Ernest: how did you like it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, awfully! I say, Doll!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t she lovely?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who, Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who! why, Eva Ceswick, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Ernest, she is very lovely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something about her tone that was not encouraging; at any rate he did
not pursue the subject.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where is Jeremy?&rdquo; he asked next.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He has gone out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently, Ernest, having finished his second cup of tea, went out too, and
came across Jeremy mooning about the yard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, my hearty! and how are you after your dissipations?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, thank you,&rdquo; answered Jeremy, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
Ernest glanced up quickly. The voice was the voice of Jeremy, but the tones
were not his tones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is up, old chap?&rdquo; he said, slipping his arm through his
friend&rsquo;s.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, there is, though. What is it? Out with it? I am a splendid father
confessor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy freed his arm, and remained sulkier than ever. Ernest looked hurt, and
the look softened the other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, of course, if you won&rsquo;t tell me, there is nothing more to be
said;&rdquo; and he prepared to move off.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As though you didn&rsquo;t know!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upon my honour I don&rsquo;t.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then if you&rsquo;ll come in here, I will tell you;&rdquo; and Jeremy
opened the door of the little outhouse, where he stuffed his birds and kept his
gun and collection of eggs and butterflies, and motioned Ernest majestically
in.
</p>

<p>
He entered and seated himself upon the stuffing-table, gazing abstractedly at a
bittern that Jeremy had shot about the time that this story opened, and which
was now very moth-eaten, and waved one melancholy leg in the air in a way meant
to be imposing, but only succeeded in being grotesque.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is it?&rdquo; he interrogated of the glassy eye of the
decaying bittern.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy turned his broad back upon Ernest&mdash;he felt that he could speak
better on such a subject with his back turned&mdash;and, addressing empty space
before him, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think it was precious unkind of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was precious unkind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To go and cut me out of the only girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ever loved?&rdquo; suggested Ernest, for he was hesitating.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ever loved!&rdquo; chimed in Jeremy; the phrase expressed his
sentiments exactly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, old chap, if you would come to the point a little more, and tell
me who the deuce you are talking about&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, who should I be talking about? there is only one girl&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ever loved?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I ever loved!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, in the name of the Holy Roman Empire, <i>who</i> is she?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Eva Ceswick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest whistled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, old chap,&rdquo; he said, after a pause, &ldquo;why didn&rsquo;t
you tell me? I didn&rsquo;t even know that you knew her. Are you engaged to
her, then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Engaged! no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, have you an understanding with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, of course not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, old fellow, if you would just slew round a bit and tell me
how the matter stands, we might get on a little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t stand at all, but&mdash;I worship the ground she treads
on; there!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s awkward, for so do
I&mdash;at least I think I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy groaned, and Ernest groaned too, by way of company.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, old chap,&rdquo; said the latter, &ldquo;what is to be done?
You should have told me, but you didn&rsquo;t, you see. If you had, I would
have kept clear. Fact is, she bowled me over altogether, bowled me
clean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So she did me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll tell you what, Jeremy, I&rsquo;ll go away and leave you to
make the running. Not that I see that there is much good in either of us making
the running, for we have nothing to marry on, and no more has she.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And we are only twenty-one. We can&rsquo;t marry at twenty-one,&rdquo;
put in Jeremy, &ldquo;or we should have a large family by the time we&rsquo;re
thirty. Fellows who marry at twenty-one always do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She&rsquo;s twenty-one; she told me so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She told me too,&rdquo; said Jeremy, determined to show that Ernest was
not the only person favoured with this exciting fact.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, shall I clear? we can&rsquo;t jaw about it for ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; said Jeremy, slowly, and in a way that showed that it cost
him an effort to say it, &ldquo;that would not be fair; besides, I expect that
the mischief is done; everybody gets fond of you, old fellow, men or women. No,
you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t go, and we won&rsquo;t get to loggerheads over it
either. I&rsquo;ll tell you what we will do&mdash;we will toss up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This struck Ernest as a brilliant suggestion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right you are,&rdquo; he said, at once producing a shilling;
&ldquo;singles or threes?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Singles, of course; it&rsquo;s sooner over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest poised the coin on his thumb.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You call. But, I say, what are we tossing for? We can&rsquo;t draw lots
for the girl like the fellows in Homer. We haven&rsquo;t captured her
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was obviously a point that required consideration. Jeremy scratched his
head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How will this do?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The winner to have a month to
make the running in, the loser not to interfere. If she won&rsquo;t have
anything to say to him after a month, then the loser to have his fling. If she
will, loser to keep clear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That will do. Stand clear; up you go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The shilling spun in the air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tails!&rdquo; howled Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
It lit on the beak of the astonished bittern and bounded off on to the floor,
finally rolling under a box full of choice specimens of the petrified bones of
antediluvian animals that had been washed out of the cliffs. The box was lugged
out of the way with difficulty, and the shilling disclosed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heads it is!&rdquo; said Ernest exultingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expected as much; just my luck. Well, shake hands, Ernest. We
won&rsquo;t quarrel about the girl, please God.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They shook hands heartily enough and parted; but from that time for many a long
day there was an invisible something between them that had not been there
before. Strong indeed must be the friendship of which the bonds do not slacken
when the shadow of a woman&rsquo;s love falls upon it.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon Dorothy said that she wanted to go into Kesterwick to make some
purchases, and Ernest offered to accompany her. They walked in silence as far
as Titheburgh Abbey; indeed, they both suffered from a curious constraint that
seemed effectually to check their usual brother-and-sister-like relations.
Ernest was just beginning to feel the silence awkward when Dorothy stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What was that?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I thought I heard somebody cry
out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They listened, and presently both heard a woman&rsquo;s voice calling for help.
The sound seemed to come from the cliff on their left. They stepped to the edge
and looked over. As may be remembered, some twenty feet from the top of the
cliff, and fifty or more from the bottom, there was at this spot a sandy ledge,
on which were deposited many of the remains washed out of the churchyard by the
sea. Now, this particular spot was almost inaccessible without ladders,
because, although it was easy enough to get down to its level, the cliff bulged
out on either side of it, and gave for the space of some yards little or no
hold for the hands or feet of the climber.
</p>

<p>
The first thing that caught Ernest&rsquo;s eyes when he looked over was a
lady&rsquo;s foot and ankle, which appeared to be resting on a tiny piece of
rock that projected from the surface of the cliff; the next was the imploring
face of Eva Ceswick, who was sprawling in a most undignified position on the
bulge of sandstone, with nothing more between her and eternity than that very
unsatisfactory and insufficient knob of rock. It was evident that she could
move neither one way or the other without being precipitated to the bottom of
the cliff, to which she was apparently clinging by suction like a fly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; exclaimed Ernest. &ldquo;Hold on, I will come to
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I <i>can&rsquo;t</i> hold much longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was one thing to say that he would come, and another to do it. The sand gave
scarcely any foothold; how was he to get enough purchase to pull Eva round the
bulge? He looked at Dorothy in despair. Her quick mind had taken in the
situation at a glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must get down there above her, Ernest, and lie flat, and stretch out
your hand to her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But there is nothing to hold to. When she puts her weight on to my hand
we shall both go together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I will hold your legs. Be quick, she is getting exhausted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It took Ernest but two seconds to reach the spot that Dorothy had pointed to,
and to lay himself flat, or rather slanting, for his heels were a great deal
higher than his head. Fortunately, he discovered a hard knob of sandstone,
against which he could rest his left hand. Meanwhile, Dorothy, seating herself
as securely as she could above, seized him by the ankles. Then Ernest stretched
his hand downwards, and, gripping Eva by the wrist, began to put out his
strength. Had the three found any time to indulge their sense of humour, they
might have found the appearance they presented intensely ludicrous; but they
did not, for the very good reason that for thirty seconds or so their lives
were not worth a farthing&rsquo;s purchase. Ernest strained and strained, but
Eva was a large woman, although she danced so lightly, and the bulge over which
he had to pull her was almost perpendicular. Presently he felt that Dorothy was
beginning to slip above him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She must make an effort, or we shall all go,&rdquo; she said in a quiet
voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Drive your knees into the sand and throw yourself forward, it is your
only chance!&rdquo; gasped Ernest to the exhausted woman beneath him.
</p>

<p>
She realised the meaning of his words, and gave a desperate struggle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pull, Doll; for God&rsquo;s sake, pull! she&rsquo;s coming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then followed a second of despairing effort, and she was beside him on the spot
where he lay; another struggle, and the three sank exhausted on the top of the
cliff, rescued from a most imminent death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; ejaculated Ernest, &ldquo;that was a near thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy nodded; she was too exhausted to speak. Eva smiled and fainted.
</p>

<p>
He turned to her with a little cry and began to chafe her cold hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, she&rsquo;s dead, Doll!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, she has fainted, give me your hat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before he could do so she had seized it, and was running as quickly as her
exhaustion would allow towards a spring that bubbled up a hundred yards away,
and which once had been the water supply of the old abbey.
</p>

<p>
Ernest went on rubbing for a minute or more, but without producing the
slightest effect. He was in despair. The beautiful face beneath him looked so
wan and death-like; all the red had left her lips. In his distress, and
scarcely knowing what he did, he bent over them and kissed them, once, twice,
thrice. That mode of restoration is not recommended in the medicine-chest
&ldquo;guide,&rdquo; but in this instance it was not without its effect.
Presently a faint and tremulous glow diffused itself over the pale cheek; in
another moment it deepened to a most unmistakable blush. (Was it a
half-consciousness of Ernest&rsquo;s new method of treatment, or merely the
returning blood, that produced the blush? Let us not inquire.) Next Eva sighed,
opened her eyes, and sat up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, you are not dead!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t think so, but I can&rsquo;t quite remember. What was
it? Ah, I know;&rdquo; and she shut her eyes, as though to keep out some horrid
sight. Presently she opened them again. &ldquo;You have saved my life,&rdquo;
she said. &ldquo;If it had not been for you, I should have now been lying
crushed at the foot of that dreadful cliff. I am so grateful.&rdquo;&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment Dorothy came back with a little water in Ernest&rsquo;s black
hat, for in her hurry she had spilled most of it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, drink some of this,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
Eva tried to do so; but a billycock hat is not a very convenient
drinking-vessel till you get used to it, and she upset more than she swallowed.
But what she drank did her good. She put down the hat, and they all three
laughed a little; it was so funny drinking out of an old hat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you long down there before we came?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, not long; only about half a minute on that dreadful bulge.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What on earth did you go there for?&rdquo; said Ernest, putting his
dripping hat on to his head, for the sun was hot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wanted to see the bones. I am very active, and thought that I could
get up quite safely; but sand is so slippery. O, I forgot; look here;&rdquo;
and she pointed to a thin cord that was tied to her wrist.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, it is tied to such an odd lead box that I found in the sand. Mr.
Jones said the other day that he thought it was a bit of an old coffin; but it
is not, it is a lead box with a rusty iron handle. I could not move it much;
but I had this bit of cord with me&mdash;I thought I might want it getting
down, you know&mdash;so I tied one end of it to the handle.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us pull it up,&rdquo; said Ernest, unfastening the cord from
Eva&rsquo;s wrist, and beginning to tug.
</p>

<p>
But the case was too heavy for him to lift alone; indeed, it proved as much as
they could all three manage to drag it to the top. However, up it came at last.
Ernest examined it carefully, and came to the conclusion that it was very
ancient. The massive iron handle at the top of the oblong case was almost eaten
through with rust, and the lead itself was much corroded, although, from
fragments that still clung to it, it was evident that it had once been
protected by an outer case of oak. Evidently the case had been washed out of
the churchyard where it had lain for centuries.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is quite exciting,&rdquo; said Eva, who was now sufficiently
interested to forget all about her escape. &ldquo;What can be in
it?&mdash;treasure or papers, I should think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered Ernest; &ldquo;I should hardly think
that they would bury such things in a churchyard. Perhaps it is a small
baby.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; broke in Dorothy, in an agitated way, &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t like that thing. I can&rsquo;t tell you why, but I am sure it is
unlucky. I wish that you would throw it back to where it came from, or into the
sea. It is a horrid thing, and we have nearly lost our lives over it
already.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Doll! whoever thought that you were so superstitious? Why,
perhaps it is full of money or jewels. Let&rsquo;s take it home and open
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not superstitious, and you can take it home if you like. I will not
touch it; I tell you it is a horrid thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, Doll, then you sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t have a share of the spoil.
Miss Ceswick and I will divide it. Will you help me to carry it to the house,
Miss Ceswick?&mdash;that is, unless you are afraid of it, like Doll.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I am not afraid; I am dying of
curiosity to see what is inside.&rdquo;
</p>

WHAT EVA FOUND</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;You are sure you are not too tired?&rdquo; said Ernest, after a
moment&rsquo;s consideration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, indeed, I have quite recovered,&rdquo; she answered, with a blush.
</p>

<p>
Ernest blushed too, from sympathy probably, and went to pick up a bough that
lay beneath a stunted oak-tree which grew in the ruins of the abbey, on the
spot where once the altar had stood. This he ran through the iron handle, and,
directing Eva to catch hold of one end, he took the other himself, and they
started for the house, Dorothy marching solemnly in front.
</p>

<p>
As it happened, Jeremy and Mr. Cardus were strolling along together smoking,
when suddenly they caught sight of the cavalcade advancing, and hurried to meet
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is all this?&rdquo; asked Mr. Cardus of Dorothy, who was now nearly
fifty yards ahead of the other two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Reginald, it is a long story. First we found Eva Ceswick slipping
down the cliff, and dragged her up just in time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My luck again!&rdquo; thought Jeremy, groaning in spirit.&rdquo; I might
have sat on the edge of that cliff for ten years, and never got a chance of
dragging her up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we pulled up that horrid box, which she found down in the sand, and
tied a cord to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; exclaimed Ernest, who was now arriving, &ldquo;and, would
you believe it, Dorothy wanted us to throw it back again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know I did; I said that it was unlucky, and it is unlucky.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Dorothy! it is very interesting. I expect that it will be
found to contain deeds buried in the churchyard for safety and never dug up
again,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Cardus, much interested. &ldquo;Let me catch hold of
that stick, Miss Ceswick, and I daresay that Jeremy will go on and get a hammer
and a cold chisel, and we will soon solve the mystery.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, very well, Reginald; you will see,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus glanced at her. It was curious her taking such an idea. Then they
walked to the house. On reaching the sitting-room they found Jeremy already
there with his hammer and chisel. He was an admirable amateur blacksmith;
indeed, there were few manual trades of which he did not know a little, and,
placing the case on the table, he set about the task of opening it in a most
workmanlike manner.
</p>

<p>
The lead, though it was in places eaten quite away, was still thick and sound
near the edges, and it took him a good quarter of an hour&rsquo;s hard chopping
to remove what appeared to be the front of the case. Excitement was at its
height as it fell forward with a bang on the table; but it was then found that
what had been removed was merely a portion of an outer case, there being
beneath it an inner chest, also of lead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Jeremy, &ldquo;they fastened it up pretty well;&rdquo;
and then he set to work again.
</p>

<p>
This inner skin of lead was thinner and easier to cut than the first had been,
and he got through the job more quickly, though not nearly quickly enough for
the impatience of the bystanders. At last the front fell out, and disclosed a
small cabinet made of solid pieces of black oak and having a hinged door, which
was fastened by a tiny latch and hasp of the common pattern, that is, probably,
as old as doors are. From this cabinet there came a strong odour of spices.
</p>

<p>
The excitement was now intense, and seemed to be shared by everybody in the
house. Grice had come in through the swing-door and stationed herself in the
background, Sampson and the groom were peeping through the window, and even old
Atterleigh, attracted by the sound of the hammering, had strolled aimlessly in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can it be?&rdquo; said Eva, with a gasp.
</p>

<p>
Slowly Jeremy extracted the cabinet from its leaden coverings and set it on the
table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I open it?&rdquo; he said; and, suiting the action to the word, he
lifted the latch, and placing the chisel between the edge of the little door
and its frame, prised the cabinet open.
</p>

<p>
The smell of spices became more pronounced than ever, and for a moment the
cloud of dust that came from them, as their fragments rolled out of the cabinet
on to the table, prevented the spectators, who, all but Dorothy, were crowding
up to the case, from seeing what it contained. Presently, however, a large
whitish bundle became visible. Jeremy put in his hand, pulled it out, and laid
it on the top of the box. It was heavy. But when he had done this he did not
seem inclined to go any further in the matter. The bundle had, he considered,
an uncanny look.
</p>

<p>
At that moment an interruption took place, for Florence Ceswick entered through
the open door. She had come up to see Dorothy, and was astonished to find such
a gathering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what is it all about?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
Somebody told her in as few words as possible, for everybody&rsquo;s attention
was concentrated on the bundle, which nobody seemed inclined to touch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, why don&rsquo;t you open it?&rdquo; asked Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that they are all afraid,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
He was watching the various expressions on the faces with an amused air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am not afraid, at any rate,&rdquo; said Florence. &ldquo;Now,
ladies and gentlemen, the Gorgon&rsquo;s head is about to be unveiled: look the
other way, or you will all be turned to stone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is getting delightfully ghastly,&rdquo; said Eva to Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know that it will be something horrid,&rdquo; added Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Florence had drawn out a heavy pin of ancient make, with which the
wrapping of the bundle was fastened, and begun to unwind a long piece of
discoloured linen. At the very first turn another shower of spices fell out. As
soon as these had been swept aside, Florence proceeded slowly with her task,
and as she removed fold after fold of the linen, the bundle began to take shape
and form, and the shape it took was that of a human head!
</p>

<p>
Eva saw it, and drew closer to Ernest; Jeremy saw it, and felt inclined to
bolt; Dorothy saw it, and knew that her presentiments as to the disagreeable
nature of the contents of that unlucky case were coming true; Mr. Cardus saw
it, and was more interested than ever. Only Florence and Hard-riding Atterleigh
saw nothing. Another turn or two of the long winding-sheet, and it slipped
suddenly away from whatever it enclosed.
</p>

<p>
There was a moment&rsquo;s dead silence as the company regarded the object thus
left open to their gaze. Then one of the women gave a low cry of fear, and,
actuated by some common impulse, they all turned and broke from the room in
terror, and calling, &ldquo;It is alive!&rdquo; No, not all. Florence turned
pale, but she stood there by the object, the winding-sheet in her hands; and
old Atterleigh also remained staring at it, either paralysed or fascinated.
</p>

<p>
It, too, seemed to stare at him from its point of vantage on the oak chest, in
which it had rested for so many centuries.
</p>

<p>
And this was what he saw there upon the box. Let the reader imagine the face
and head of a lovely woman of some thirty years of age, the latter covered with
rippling brown locks of great length, above which was set a roughly fashioned
coronet studded with uncut gems. Let him imagine this face, all but the lips,
which were coloured red, pale with the bloodless pallor of death, and the flesh
so firm and fresh-looking that it might have been that of a corpse not a day
old; so firm, indeed, that the head and all its pendant weight of beautiful
hair could stand on the unshrunken base of the neck which, in some far-past
age, cold steel had made so smooth. Then let him imagine the crowning horror of
this weird sight. The eyes of a corpse are shut, but the eyes in this head were
wide open, and the long black lashes, as perfect now as on the day of death,
hung over what, when the light struck them, appeared to be two balls of
trembling fire, that glittered and rolled and fixed themselves upon the face of
the observer like living human eyes. It was these awful eyes that carried such
terror to the hearts of the on-lookers when they cast their first glance
around, and made them not unnaturally cry out that the head was alive.
</p>

<p>
It was not until he had made a very careful examination of these fiery orbs
that Mr. Cardus was afterwards able to discover what they were; and as the
reader may as well understand at once that this head had nothing about it
different from any other skilfully preserved head, he shall be taken into
confidence without delay. They were balls of crystal fitted, probably by the
aid of slender strings, into the eye sockets with such infernal art that they
shook and trembled to the slightest sound, and even on occasion rolled about.
The head itself, he also discovered, had not been embalmed in the ordinary
fashion, by extracting the brain, and filling the cavity with spices or
bitumen, but had been preserved by means of the injection of silica, or some
kindred substance, into the brain, veins, and arteries, which, after permeating
all the flesh, had solidified and made it like marble. Some brilliant pigment
had been used to give the lips their natural colour, and the hair had been
preserved by means of the spices. But perhaps the most dreadful thing about
this relic of forgotten ages was the mocking smile that the artist who
&ldquo;set it up&rdquo; had managed to preserve upon the face&mdash;a
smile that just drew the lips up enough to show the white teeth beneath, and
gave the idea that its wearer had died in the full enjoyment of some malicious
jest or triumph. It was a terrible thing to look on, that long-dead, beautiful
face, with its abundant hair, its crowning coronet, its moving crystal eyes,
and its smile; and yet there was something awfully fascinating about it: those
who had seen it once would always long to see it again.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus had fled with the rest, but as soon as he got outside the swing-door
his common sense reasserted itself, and he stopped.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come,&rdquo; he called to the others, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t be so
silly; you are not going to run away from a dead woman&rsquo;s head, are
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You ran too,&rdquo; said Dorothy, pulling up and gasping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I know I did; those eyes startled me; but, of course, they are
glass. I am going back; it is a great curiosity.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is an accursed thing,&rdquo; muttered Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus turned and re-entered the room, and the others, comforting
themselves with the reflection that it was broad daylight, and drawn by their
devouring curiosity, followed him. That is, they all followed him except Grice,
who was ill for two days afterwards. As for Sampson and the groom, who had seen
the sight through the window, they ran for a mile or more along the cliff
before they stopped.
</p>

<p>
When they got back into the room, they found old Atterleigh still standing and
staring at the crystal eyes, that seemed to be returning his gaze with compound
interest, while Florence was there with the long linen wrapper in her hand,
gazing down at the beautiful hair that flowed from the head on to the oak box,
from the box to the table, and from the table nearly to the ground. It was,
oddly enough, of the same colour and texture as her own. She had taken off her
hat when she began to undo the wrappings, and they all noticed the fact. Nor
did the resemblance stop there. The sharp fine features of the mummied head
were very like Florence&rsquo;s; so were the beautiful teeth and the fixed hard
smile. The dead face was more lovely, indeed, but otherwise the woman of the
Saxon era&mdash;for, to judge from the rude tiara on her brow, it is probable
that she was Saxon&mdash;and the living girl of the nineteenth century might
have been sisters, or mother and daughter. The resemblance startled them all as
they entered the room, but they said nothing.
</p>

<p>
They drew near, and gazed again without a word. Dorothy was the first to break
the silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think she must have been a witch,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I hope that
you will have it thrown away, Reginald, for she will bring us bad luck. The
place where she was buried has been unlucky; it was a great abbey once, now it
is a deserted ruin. When we tried to get the case up, we were all very nearly
killed. She will bring us bad luck. I am sure of it. Throw it away, Reginald,
throw her into the sea. Look, she is just like Florence there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence had smiled at Dorothy&rsquo;s words, and the resemblance became more
striking than ever. Eva shuddered as she noticed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Dorothy!&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, who was a bit of an
antiquarian, and had now forgotten his start in his collector&rsquo;s zeal,
&ldquo;it is a splendid find. But I forgot,&rdquo; he added, in a tone of
disappointment, &ldquo;it does not belong to me, it belongs to Miss
Ceswick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, I am sure you are welcome to it, so far as I am concerned,&rdquo;
said Eva, hastily. &ldquo;I would not have it near me on any account.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, very well. I am much obliged to you. I shall value the relic very
much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence had meanwhile moved round the table, and was gazing earnestly into the
crystal eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing, Florence?&rdquo; asked Ernest, sharply, for the
scene was uncanny, and jarred upon him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I?&rdquo; she answered, with a little laugh; &ldquo;I am seeking an
inspiration. That face looks wise, it may teach me something. Besides, it is so
like my own, I think she must be some far-distant ancestress.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So she has noticed it too,&rdquo; thought Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Put her back in the box, Jeremy,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus. &ldquo;I must
have an air-tight case made.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can do that,&rdquo; said Jeremy, &ldquo;by lining the old one with
lead, and putting a glass front to it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy set about putting the head away, touching it very gingerly. When he got
it back into the oak case, he dusted it, and placed it upon a bracket that
jutted from the oak panelling at the end of the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;now that you have put your guardian
angel on her pedestal, I think that we must be going home. Will any of you walk
a little way with us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy said that they would all come&mdash;that is, all except Mr. Cardus, who
had gone back to his office. Accordingly they started, and as they did so,
Florence intimated to Ernest that she wished to speak to him. He was alarmed
and disappointed, for he was afraid of Florence, and wished to walk with Eva,
and presumably his face betrayed what was in his mind to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not be frightened,&rdquo; she said, with a slight smile; &ldquo;I am
not going to say anything disagreeable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of course he replied that he knew that she never could say anything
disagreeable at any time; at which she smiled again the same faint smile, and
they dropped behind.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; she said presently, &ldquo;I want to speak to you. You
remember what happened between us two evenings ago on this very beach;&rdquo;
for they were walking home by the beach.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Florence, I remember,&rdquo; answered Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ernest, the words I have to say are hard for a woman&rsquo;s lips,
but I must say them. I made a mistake, Ernest, in telling you that I loved you
as I did, and in talking all the wild nonsense that I talked. I don&rsquo;t
know what made me do it&mdash;some foolish impulse, no doubt. Women are very
curious, you know, Ernest, and I think that I am more curious than most. I
suppose I thought I loved you, Ernest&mdash;I know I thought it when you kissed
me; but last night, when I saw you at the Smythes&rsquo; dance, I knew that it
was all a mistake, and that I cared for you&mdash;no more than you cared for
me, Ernest. Do you understand me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not understand her in the least, but he nodded his head, feeling vaguely
that things were turning out very well for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is all right; and so here, in the same place where I said them, I
renounce them. We will forget all that foolish scene, Ernest. I made a little
mistake when I told you that my heart was as deep as the sea; I find that it is
shallow as a brook. But will you answer me one question, Ernest, before we
close this conversation?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Florence, if I can.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, when you&mdash;you kissed me the other night, you did not really
mean it, did you? I mean you only did so for a freak, or from the impulse of
the moment, not because you loved me? Don&rsquo;t be afraid to tell me, because
if it was so, I shall not be angry; you see you have so much to forgive me for.
I am breaking faith, am I not?&rdquo; And she looked him straight in the face
with her piercing eyes.
</p>

<p>
Ernest&rsquo;s glance fell under that searching gaze, and the lie that men are
apt to think it no shame to use where women are concerned rose to his lips. But
he could not get it out&mdash;he could not bring himself to say that he did
love her&mdash;so he compromised matters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think you were more in earnest than I was, Florence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laughed, a cold little laugh, that somehow made his flesh creep.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you for being candid: it makes matters so much easier, does it
not? But, do you know, I suspected as much, when I was standing there by that
head to-day, just at the time that you took Eva&rsquo;s hand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest started visibly. &ldquo;Why, your back was turned!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I saw what you did reflected in the crystal eyes. Well, do you
know, as I stood there, it seemed to me as though I could consider the whole
matter as dispassionately and with as clear a brain as though I had been that
dead woman. All of a sudden I grew wise. But there are the others waiting for
us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall part friends, I hope, Florence?&rdquo; said Ernest anxiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, Ernest, a woman always follows the career of her old admirer with
the deepest interest, and for about five seconds you were my admirer&mdash;when
you kissed me, you know. I shall watch all your life, and my thoughts shall
follow your footsteps like a shadow. Good-night, Ernest, good-night;&rdquo; and
again she smiled that mocking smile which was so like that on the features of
the dead woman, and fixed her piercing eyes upon his face. He bade her
good-night, and made his way homewards with the others, feeling an undefinable
dread heavy on his heart.

<h2><a name="chap11"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/>
DEEP WATERS</h2>

<p>
In due course Jeremy duly fitted up &ldquo;the witch,&rdquo; as the mysterious
head came to be called at Dum&rsquo;s Ness in her air-tight cabinet, which he
lengthened till it looked like a clock-case, in order to allow the beautiful
hair to hang down at full length, retaining, however, the original door and
ancient latch and hasp. His next step was to fit the plate-glass front, and
exhaust the air as well as was feasible from the interior of the case. Then he
screwed on the outside door, and stood it back on its bracket in the
oak-paneled sitting-room, where, as has been said, it looked for all the world
like an eight-day clock-case.
</p>

<p>
Just as he had finished the job, a visitor&mdash;it was Mr. de Talor&mdash;came
in, and remarked that he had made a precious ugly clock. Jeremy, who disliked
<i>the</i> De Talor, as he called him, excessively, said that he would not say
so when he had seen the works, and at the same time unhasped the oak door of
the cabinet, and turned the full glare of the dreadful crystal eyes on to his
face. The results were startling. For a moment De Talor stared and gasped; then
all the rich hues faded from his features, and he sank back in a sort of fit.
Jeremy shut up the door in a hurry, and his visitor soon recovered; but for
years nothing would induce him to enter that room again.
</p>

<p>
As for Jeremy himself, at first he was dreadfully afraid of &ldquo;the
witch,&rdquo; but as time went on&mdash;for his job took him several
days&mdash;he seemed to lose his awe of her, and even to find a fearful joy in
her society. He spent whole hours, as he sat in his workshop in the yard,
tinkering at the airtight case, in weaving histories in which this beautiful
creature, whose head had been thus marvellously recovered, played the leading
part. It was so strange to look at her lovely scornful face, and think that,
long ages since, men had loved it, and kissed it, and played with the waving
hair.
</p>

<p>
There it was, this relic of the dead, preserved by the consummate skill of some
old monk or chemist, so that it retained all its ancient beauty long after the
echoes of the tragedy, with which it must have been connected, had died out of
the world. For, as he wrought at his case, Jeremy grew certain that it was the
ghastly memento of some enormous crime; indeed, by degrees, as he tacked and
hammered at the lead lining, he made up a history that was quite satisfactory
to his mind, appealing on doubtful points to the witch herself, who was on the
table near him, and ascertaining whether she meant &ldquo;yes&rdquo; or
&ldquo;no&rdquo; by the simple process of observing whether or not her eyes
trembled when he spoke. It was slow work getting the story together in this
fashion, but then the manufacture of the case was slow also, and it was not
without its charm, for he felt it an honour to be taken into the confidence of
so lovely a lady.
</p>

<p>
But if the head had a fascination for Jeremy, it had a still greater charm for
his grandfather. The old man would continually slip out of the office and cross
the yard to the little room where Jeremy worked, in order to stare at this
wonderful relic. One night, indeed, when the case was nearly finished, Jeremy
remembered that he had not locked the door of his workshop. He was already half
undressed, but slipping on his coat again, he went out by the back door and
crossed the yard, carrying the key with him. It was bright moonlight, and
Jeremy, having slippers on, walked without noise. When he reached the workshop,
and was about to lock the door, he thought he heard a sound in the room. This
startled him, and for a moment he meditated retreat, leaving the head to look
after itself. Those eyes were interesting in the daytime, but he scarcely cared
to face them alone at night. It was foolish, but they did look so very much
alive! After a moment&rsquo;s hesitation, during which the sound, whatever it
was, again made itself audible, he determined to compromise matters by going
round to the other side of the room and looking in at the little window. With a
beating heart he stole round, and quietly peeped in. The moonlight was shining
bright into the room, and struck full upon the long case he had manufactured.
He had left it <i>shut</i>, and the head inside it. Now it was open; he could
clearly see the white outlines of the trembling eyes. The sound, too&mdash;a
muttering sound&mdash;was still going on. Jeremy drew back, and wiped the
perspiration from his forehead, and for the second time thought of flight. But
his curiosity overcame him, and he looked again. This time he discovered the
cause of the muttering. Seated upon his carpentering-bench was his grandfather,
old Atterleigh, who appeared to be staring with all his might at the head, and
talking incoherently to himself. This was the noise he had heard through the
door. It was an uncanny sight, and made Jeremy feel cold down the back. While
he was still contemplating it, and wondering what to do, old Atterleigh rose,
closed the case, and left the room. Jeremy slipped round, locked up the door,
and made his way back to bed much astonished. He did not, however, say anything
of what he had seen, only in future he was careful never to leave the door of
his workshop open.
</p>

<p>
At last the case was finished, and, for an amateur, a very good job he made of
it. When it was done he placed it, as already narrated, back on the bracket,
and showed it to Mr. de Talor.
</p>

<p>
But from the day when Eva Ceswick nearly fell to the bottom of the cliff in the
course of her antiquarian researches, things began to go wrong at Dum&rsquo;s
Ness. Everybody felt it except Ernest, and he was thinking too much of other
things. Dorothy was very unhappy in those days, and began to look thin and
miserable, though she sturdily alleged, when asked, that she never had been
better in her life. Jeremy himself was also unhappy, and for a good reason. He
had caught the fever that women like Eva Ceswick have it in their power to give
to the sons of men. His was a deep self-contained nature, very gentle and
tender, not admitting many things into its affections, but loving such as were
admitted with all the heart and soul and strength. And it was in the deepest
depths of this loyal nature that Eva Ceswick had printed her image; before he
knew it, before he had time to think, it was photographed there upon his heart,
and he felt that there it must stay for good or evil; that plate could never be
used again.
</p>

<p>
She had been so kind to him; her eyes had grown so bright and friendly when she
saw him coming! He was sure that she liked him (which indeed she did), and once
he had ventured to press her little hand, and he had thought that she returned
the pressure, and had not slept all night in consequence.
</p>

<p>
But perhaps this was a mistake. And then, just as he was getting on so nicely,
came Ernest, and scattered his hopes like mists before the morning sun. From
the moment that those two met, he knew that it was all up with his chance. And
next, to make assurance doubly sure, Providence itself, in the shape of a
shilling, had declared against him, and he was left lamenting. Well, it was all
fair; but still it was very hard, and for the first time in his life he felt
inclined to be angry with Ernest. Indeed, he was angry, and the fact made him
more unhappy than ever, because he knew that his anger was unjust, and because
his brotherly love condemned it.
</p>

<p>
But for all that, the shadow between them grew darker.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus, too, had his troubles, connected, needless to say&mdash;for nothing
else ever really troubled him&mdash;with his monomania of revenge. Mr. de
Talor, of whose discomfiture he had at last made sure, had unexpectedly slipped
out of his power, nor could he at present see any way in which to draw him back
again. Consequently he was distressed. As for Hard-riding Atterleigh, ever
since he had found himself fixed by &ldquo;the witch&rsquo;s&rdquo; crystal
eye, he had been madder than ever, and more perfectly convinced that Mr. Cardus
was the devil in person. Indeed, Dorothy, who watched over the old man, the
grandfather who never knew her, thought that she observed a marked change in
him. He worked away at his writing as usual, but, it appeared to her, with more
vigour, as though it were a thing to encounter and get rid of. He would cut the
notches out of his stick calendar, too, more eagerly than heretofore, and
altogether it seemed as though his life had become dominated by some new
purpose. She called Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s attention to this change; but he
laughed, and said that it was nothing, and would probably pass with the moon.
</p>

<p>
But if nobody else was happy, Ernest was&mdash;that is, except when he was sunk
in the depths of woe, which was, on an average, about three days a week. On the
occasion of these seizures, Dorothy, noting his miserable aspect and entire
want of appetite, felt much alarmed, and took an occasion after supper to ask
him what was the matter. Before many minutes were over she had cause to regret
it; for Ernest burst forth with a history of his love and his wrongs that
lasted for an hour. It appeared that another young gentleman, one of those who
danced with the lovely Eva at the Smythes&rsquo; ball, had been making the most
unmistakable advances; he had called&mdash;three times; he had sent
flowers&mdash;twice (Ernest sent them every morning, beguiling Sampson into
cutting the best orchid-blooms for that purpose); he had been out
walking&mdash;once. Dorothy listened quietly, till he ceased of his own accord.
Then she spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you really love her, Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Love her! I&rdquo;&mdash;but we will not enter into a description of
this young man&rsquo;s raptures. When he had done, Dorothy did a curious thing.
She rose from her chair, and coming to where Ernest was sitting, bent over him,
and kissed him on the forehead, and as she did so he noticed vaguely that she
had great black rings round her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope that you will be happy, my dear brother. You will have a lovely
wife, and I think that she is as good as she is beautiful.&rdquo; She spoke
quite quietly, but somehow her voice sounded like a sob. He kissed her in
acknowledgment, and she glided away.
</p>

<p>
Ernest did not think much of the incident, however. Indeed, in five minutes his
thoughts were back with Eva, with whom he really was seriously and earnestly in
love. In sober truth, the antics that he played were enough to make the angels
weep to see a human being possessing the normal weight of brain making such a
donkey of himself. For instance, he would promenade for hours at night in the
neighbourhood of the Cottage. Once he ventured into the garden to enjoy the
perfect bliss of staring at six panes of glass, got severely bitten by the
house-dog for his pains, and was finally chased for a mile or more by both the
dog and the policeman, who, having heard of the mysterious figure that was to
be seen mooning (in every sense of the word) round the Cottage, had laid up to
watch for him. Next day he had the satisfaction of hearing from his
adored&rsquo;s own lips the story of the attempted burglary, but as she told it
there was a smile playing about the corners of her mouth which almost seemed to
indicate that she had her suspicions as to who the burglar was. And then Ernest
walked so very lame, which, considering that the teeth of a brute called Towzer
had made a big hole in his calf, was not to be wondered at.
</p>

<p>
After this he was obliged to give up his midnight sighing, but he took it out
in other ways. Once indeed, without warning, he flopped down on to the floor
and kissed Eva&rsquo;s hand, and then, aghast at his own boldness, fled from
the room.
</p>

<p>
At first all this amused Eva greatly. She was pleased at her conquest, and
took a malicious pleasure in leading Ernest on. When she knew that he was
coming she would make herself look as lovely as possible, and put on all her
charming little ways and graces in order to more thoroughly enslave him.
Somehow, whenever Ernest thought of her in after years as she was at that
period of her life, his memory would call up a vision of her in a pretty little
drawing-room at the Cottage, leaning back in a low chair in such a way as to
contrive to show off her splendid figure to the best advantage, and also the
tiny foot and slender ankle that peeped from beneath her soft white dress.
There she sat, a little Skye-terrier called &ldquo;Tails&rdquo; on her lap,
with which his rival had presented her but a fortnight before,
and&mdash;yes&mdash;actually kissing the brute at intervals, her eyes shining
all the time with innocent coquetry. What would not Ernest have given to occupy
for a single minute the position of that unappreciative Skye-terrier! It was
agony to see so many kisses wasted on a dog, and Eva, seeing that he thought
so, kissed the animal more vigorously than ever.
</p>

<p>
At last he could stand it no longer. &ldquo;Put that dog down!&rdquo; he said,
peremptorily.
</p>

<p>
She obeyed him, and then, remembering that he had no right to dictate to her
what she should do, made an effort to pick it up again; but
&ldquo;Tails,&rdquo; who, be it added, was not used to being kissed in private
life, and thought the whole operation rather a bore, promptly bolted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why should I put the dog down?&rdquo; she asked, with a quick look of
defiance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because I hate to see you kissing it; it is so effeminate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke in a masterful way; it was a touch of the curb, and there are few
things a proud woman hates so much as the first touch of the curb.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What right have you to dictate what I shall or shall not do?&rdquo; she
asked, tapping her foot upon the floor.
</p>

<p>
Ernest was very humble in those days, and he collapsed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None at all. Don&rsquo;t be angry, Eva&rdquo; (it was the first time
that he had called her so; till now she had always been Miss Ceswick),
&ldquo;but the fact was I could not bear to see you kissing that dog; I was
jealous of the brute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Whereupon she blushed furiously and changed the subject. But after a while
Eva&rsquo;s coquettishness began to be less and less marked. When they met she
no longer greeted him with a smile of mischief, but with serious eyes that once
or twice, he thought, bore traces of tears. At the same time she threw him into
despair by her coldness. Did he venture a tender remark, she would pretend not
to hear it&mdash;alas, that the mounting blood should so obstinately proclaim
that she did! Did he touch her hand, it was cold and unresponsive. She was
quieter too, and her reserve frightened him. Once he tried to break it, and
began some passionate appeal, but she rose without answering and turned her
face to the window. He followed her, and saw that her dark eyes were full of
tears. This he felt was even more awful than her coldness, and, fearing that he
had offended her, he obeyed her whispered entreaty and went. Poor boy! he was
very young. Had he had a little more experience, he might have found means to
brush away her tears and his own doubts. It is a melancholy thing that such
opportunities should, as a rule, present themselves before people are old
enough to take advantage of them.
</p>

<p>
The secret of all this change of conduct was not far to seek. Eva had played
with edged tools till she cut her fingers to the bone. The dark-eyed boy, who
danced so well and had such a handsome, happy face, had become very dear to
her. She had begun by playing with him, and now, alas! she loved him better
than anybody in the world. That was the sting of the thing; she had fallen in
love with a <i>boy</i> as young as herself&mdash;a boy, too, who, so far as she
was aware, had no particular prospects in life. It was humiliating to her pride
to think that she, who in the few months that she had been &ldquo;out&rdquo; in
London, before her cousins rose up and cast her forth, had already found the
satisfaction of seeing one or two men of middle age and established position at
her feet, and the further satisfaction of requesting them to kneel there no
more, should in the upshot have to strike her colours to a boy of twenty-one,
even though he did stand six feet high, and had more wits in his young head and
more love in his young heart than all her middle-aged admirers put together.
</p>

<p>
Perhaps, though she was a woman grown, she was not herself quite old enough to
appreciate the great advantage it is to any girl to stamp her image upon the
heart of the man she loves while the wax is yet soft and undefaced by the half
worn-out marks of many shallow dies; perhaps she did not know what a blessing
it is to be able to really <i>love</i> a man at all, young, middle-aged, or
old. Many women wait till they cannot love without shame to make that
discovery. Perhaps she forgot that Ernest&rsquo;s youth was a fault which would
mend day by day, and he had abilities, which, if she would consent to inspire
them, might lead him to great things. At any rate, two facts remained in her
mind after much thinking: she loved him with all her heart, and she was ashamed
of it.
</p>

<p>
But as yet she could not make up her mind to any fixed course. It would have
been easy to crush poor Ernest, to tell him that his pretensions were
ridiculous, to send him away, or to go away herself, and so to make an end of a
position that she felt was getting absurd, and which we may be sure her elder
sister Florence did nothing to make more pleasant. But she could not do it;
that was the long and short of the matter. The idea of living without Ernest
made her feel cold all over; it seemed to her that the only hours that she
really did live were the hours which they spent together, and that when he went
away he took her heart with him. No, she could not make up her mind to that;
the thought was too cruel. Then there was the other alternative&mdash;to
encourage him a little and become engaged to him, to brave everything for his
sake. But as yet she could not make up her mind to that either.
</p>

<p>
Eva Ceswick was very loving, very sweet, and very good, but she did not possess
a determined mind.

<h2><a name="chap12"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/>
DEEPER YET</h2>

<p>
While Ernest was wooing and Eva doubting, Time, whose interest in earthly
affairs is that of the sickle in the growing crop, went on his way as usual.
</p>

<p>
The end of August came, as it has come so many thousand times since this globe
gave its first turn in space, as it will come for many thousand times more,
till at last, its appointed course run out, the world darkens, quivers, and
grows still; and, behold! Ernest was still wooing, Eva still doubting.
</p>

<p>
One evening&mdash;it was a very beautiful evening&mdash;this pair were walking
together on the sea-shore. Whether they met by appointment or by accident does
not matter; they did meet, and there they were, strolling along together, as
fully charged with intense feeling as a thunder-cloud with electricity, and
almost as quiet. The storm had not yet burst.
</p>

<p>
To listen to the talk of these two, they might have met for the first time
yesterday. It was chiefly about the weather.
</p>

<p>
Presently, in the course of their wanderings, they came to a little
sailing-boat drawn up upon the beach&mdash;not far up, however, just out of the
reach of the waves. By this boat, in an attitude of intense contemplation,
there stood an ancient mariner. His hands were in his pockets, his pipe was in
his mouth, his eyes were fixed upon the deep. Apparently he did not notice
their approach till they were within two yards of him. Then he turned,
&ldquo;dashed&rdquo; himself, and asked the lady, with a pull of his grizzled
fore-lock, if she would not take a sail.
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked surprised.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How&rsquo;s the wind?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Straight off shore, sir; will turn with the turn of the tide, sir, and
bring you back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Will you come for a bit of a sail, Eva?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, thank you. I must be getting home; it is seven
o&rsquo;clock.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no hurry for you to get home. Your aunt and Florence have gone
to tea with the Smythes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I cannot come; I could not think of such a thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her words were unequivocal, but the ancient mariner put a strange
interpretation upon them. First he hauled up the little sail, and then, placing
his brown hands against the stern of the boat, he rested his weight upon them,
and caused her to travel far enough into the waves to float her bow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not coming, indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Now,</i> miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will <i>not</i> come, Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come,&rdquo; said Ernest, quietly holding out his hand to help her in.
</p>

<p>
She took it and got in. Ernest and the mariner gave a strong shove, and as the
light boat took the water the former leaped in, and at the same second a puff
of wind caught the sail, and took them ten yards out or more.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, the sailor is left behind!&rdquo; said Eva.
</p>

<p>
Ernest gave a twist to the tiller to get the boat&rsquo;s head straight off
shore, and then leisurely looked round. The mariner was standing as they had
found him, his hands in his pockets, his pipe in his mouth, his eye fixed upon
the deep.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He doesn&rsquo;t seem to mind it,&rdquo; he said, meditatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but I do; you must go back and fetch him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus appealed to, Ernest went through some violent manoeuvres with the tiller,
without producing any marked effect on the course of the boat, which by this
time had got out of the shelter of the cliff, and was bowling along merrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait till we get clear of the draught from the cliff, and I will bring
her round.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But when at last they were clear from the draught of the cliff, and he slowly
got her head round, lo and behold, the mariner had vanished!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How unfortunate!&rdquo; said Ernest, getting her head towards the open
sea again; &ldquo;he has probably gone to his tea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva tried hard to get angry, but somehow she could not: she only succeeded in
laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I thought that you had done this on purpose, I would never come out
with you again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked horrified. &ldquo;On purpose!&rdquo; he said; and the subject
dropped.
</p>

<p>
They were sitting side by side in the stern-sheets of the boat, and the sun was
just dipping all red-hot into the ocean. Under the lee of the cliff there were
cool shadows; before them was a path of glory that led to a golden gate. The
air was very sweet, and for those two all the world was lovely; there was no
sorrow on the earth, there were no storms upon the sea.
</p>

<p>
Eva took off her hat, and let the sweet breeze play upon her brow. Then she
leaned over the side, and, dipping her hand into the cool water, watched the
little track it made.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know I am going away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hand was withdrawn with a start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going away! when?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The day after to-morrow; to Guernsey first, then to France.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And when are you coming back again?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that depends upon you, Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The hand went back into the water. They were a mile or more from the shore now.
Ernest manipulated the sail and tiller so as to sail slowly parallel with the
coast-line. Then he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eva, for God&rsquo;s sake look at me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was something in his voice that forced her to obey. She took her hand out
of the water and turned her eyes on to his face. It was pale, and the lips were
quivering.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I love you,&rdquo; he said, in a low, choked voice.
</p>

<p>
She grew angry. &ldquo;Why did you bring me here? I will go home. This is
nonsense; you are nothing but a boy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There are moments in life when the human face is capable of conveying a more
intense and vivid impression than any words, when it seems to speak to the very
soul in a language of its own. And so it was with Ernest now: he made no answer
to her reproaches, but, if that were possible, his features grew paler yet, and
his eyes, shining like stars, fixed themselves upon her, and drew her to him.
And what they said she and he knew alone, nor could any words convey it, for
the tongue in which they talked is not spoken in this world.
</p>

<p>
A moment still she wavered, fighting against the sweet mastery of his will with
all her woman&rsquo;s strength, and then&mdash;O Heaven! it was done, and his
arms were round about her, her head upon his breast, and her voice was lost in
sobs and broken words of love.
</p>

<p>
O, radiant-winged hour of more than mortal joy; the hearts which you have
touched will know when their time comes that they have not beat quite in vain!
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus04"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig04.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;O, radiant-winged hour!&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
And so they sat, those two, quite silent, for there seemed to be no need for
speech; words could not convey half they had to say, and, indeed, to tell the
honest truth, their lips were, for the most part, otherwise employed.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile the sun went down, and the sweet moon arose over the quiet sea, and
turned their little ship to silver. Eva gently disengaged herself from his
arms, and half-rose to look at it; she had never thought it half so beautiful
before. Ernest looked at it too. It is a way that lovers have.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know the lines?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;I think I can say them:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;With a swifter motion,<br/>
Out upon the ocean,<br/>
Heaven above and round us, and you along with me:<br/>
Heaven around and o&rsquo;er us,<br/>
The Infinite before us,<br/>
Floating on for ever, upon the flowing sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; she said, softly.
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;&lsquo;What time is it, dear, now?<br/>
We are in the year now<br/>
Of the New Creation, one million, two, or three;<br/>
But where are we now, love?<br/>
We are, as I trow, love,<br/>
In the Heaven of Heavens, upon the Crystal Sea.&rsquo;&rdquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is how I hope it may be with us, dear,&rdquo; she said, taking his
hand, as the last words passed his lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you happy now?&rdquo; he asked her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Ernest, I am happy indeed. I do not think that I shall ever be so
happy again; certainly I never was so happy before. Do you know, dear, I wish
to tell you so, that you may see how mean I have been; I have fought so hard
against my love for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He looked pained. &ldquo;Why?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will tell you quite truly, Ernest&mdash;because you are so young. I
was ashamed to fall in love with a boy, and yet you see, dear, you have been
too strong for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, there is no difference in our ages!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Ernest, but I am a woman, and ever so much older than you. We age so
much quicker, you know. I feel about old enough to be your mother,&rdquo; she
said, with a pretty assumption of dignity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I feel quite old enough to be your lover,&rdquo; he replied,
impertinently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So it seems. But, Ernest, if three months ago anybody had told me that I
should be in love to-day with a boy of twenty-one, I would not have believed
them. Dear, I have given you all my heart; you will not betray me, will you?
You know very young men are apt to change their minds.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He flushed a little as he answered, feeling that it was tiresome to have the
unlucky fact that he was only twenty-one so persistently thrust before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then they are young men who have not had the honour of winning your
affections. A man who has once loved you could never forget you. Indeed, it is
more likely that you will forget me; you will have plenty of temptation to do
so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She saw that she had vexed him. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t be angry, dear; but you see
the position is a very difficult one, and, if I could not be quite sure of you,
it would be intolerable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My darling, you may be as sure of me as woman can be of man; but
don&rsquo;t begin your doubts over again. They are settled now. Let us be quite
happy just this one evening. No doubt there are plenty coming when we shall not
be able to.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so they kissed each other and sailed on&mdash;homeward, alas! for it was
getting late&mdash;and were perfectly happy.
</p>

<p>
Presently they drew near the shore, and there, at the identical spot where they
had left him, stood the ancient mariner. His hands were in his pockets, his
pipe was in his mouth, his eyes were fixed upon the deep.
</p>

<p>
Ernest grounded the little boat skilfully enough, and, jumping over the bow, he
and the mariner pulled it up. Then Eva got out, and as she did so she thought,
in the moonlight, that she noticed something resembling a twinkle in the
latter&rsquo;s ancient eye. She felt confused&mdash;there is nothing so
confusing as a guilty conscience&mdash;and, to cover her confusion, plunged
into conversation, while Ernest was finding some money to pay for the boat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you often let boats?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, miss, only to Mr. Ernest in a general way&rdquo; (so that wicked
Ernest had set a trap to catch her).
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, then, I suppose you go out fishing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, miss, only for rikkration, like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then what do you do?&rdquo;&mdash;she was getting curious on the point.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Times I does nothing; times I stands on the beach and sees things; times
I runs cheeses, miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Run cheeses!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss, Dutch ones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He means that he brings cargoes of Dutch cheeses to Harwich.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; said Eva.
</p>

<p>
Ernest paid the man, and they turned to go. She had not gone many yards when
she felt a heavy hand laid upon her shoulder. Turning round in astonishment,
she perceived the mariner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, miss,&rdquo; he said, in a hoarse whisper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Niver you eat the rind of a Dutch cheese!</i> I says it as
knows.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva did not forget his advice.

<h2><a name="chap13"></a>CHAPTER XIII.<br/>
MR. CARDUS UNFOLDS HIS PLANS</h2>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, on the morning following the events
described in the previous chapter, &ldquo;I want to speak to you in my
office&mdash;and you too, Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They both followed him into his room, wondering what was the matter. He sat
down and so did they, and then, as was his habit, letting his eyes stray over
every part of their persons except their faces, he began:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is time that you two fellows took to doing something for yourselves.
You must not learn to be idle men&mdash;not that most young men require much
teaching in that way. What do you propose to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy and Ernest stared at one another rather blankly, but apparently Mr.
Cardus did not expect an answer. At any rate, he went on before either of them
could frame one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t seem to know, never gave the matter any consideration
probably; quite content to obey the Bible literally, and take no thought for
the morrow. Well, it is lucky that you have somebody to think for you. Now I
will tell you what I propose for you both. I want you, Ernest, to go to the
bar. It is a foolish profession for most young men to take to, but it will not
be so in your case, because, as it happens, if you show yourself capable, I
shall by degrees be able to put a good deal of business in your
hands&mdash;Chancery business, for I have little to do with any other. I
daresay that you will wonder where the business is to come from. I don&rsquo;t
seem to do very much here, do I? with a mad old hunting-man as a clerk, and
Dorothy to copy my private letters; but I do, for all that. I may as well tell
you both, in confidence, that this place is only the head-centre of my
business. I have another office in London, another at Ipswich, and another at
Norwich, though they all carry on business under different names; besides which
I have other agencies of a different nature. But all this is neither here nor
there. I have communicated with Aster, the rising Chancery man, and he will
have a vacancy in his chambers next term. Let me see&mdash;term begins on
November 2nd; I propose, Ernest, to write to-day to enter you at
Lincoln&rsquo;s Inn. I shall make you an allowance of three hundred a year,
which you must clearly understand you must not exceed. I think that is all I
have to say about the matter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure I am very much obliged to you, uncle&mdash;&rdquo; began
Ernest, fervently, for since the previous evening he had clearly realised that
it was necessary for him to make a beginning of doing something.
</p>

<p>
But his uncle cut him short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, Ernest, we will understand all that. Now, Jeremy, for you. I
propose that you shall be articled to me, and if you work well and prove
useful, it is my intention in time to admit you to a share of the business. In
order that you may not feel entirely dependent, it is my further intention to
make you an allowance also, on the amount of which I have not yet
settled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy groaned in spirit at the thought of becoming a lawyer, even with a
&ldquo;share of the business,&rdquo; but he remembered his conversation with
Dorothy, and thanked Mr. Cardus with the best grace that he could muster.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, then; I will have the articles prepared at once, and you can
take to your stool in the office next week. I think that is all I have to
say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Acting on this hint, the pair were departing, Jeremy in the deepest state of
depression, induced by the near prospect of that stool, when Mr. Cardus called
Ernest back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to you about something else,&rdquo; he said
thoughtfully. &ldquo;Shut the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest turned cold down his back, and wondered if his uncle could have heard
anything about Eva. He had the full intention of speaking to him about the
matter, but it would be awkward to be boarded himself before he had made up his
mind what to say. He shut the door, and then walking to the glass entrance to
the orchid blooming-house, stood looking at the flowers, and waiting for Mr.
Cardus to begin. But he did not begin; he seemed to be lost in thought.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, uncle,&rdquo; he said at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a delicate business, Ernest, but I may as well get it over. I am
going to make a request of you, a request to which I beg you will give me no
immediate answer, for from its nature it will require the most anxious and
careful consideration. I want you to listen, and say nothing. You can give me
your answer when you come back from abroad. At the same time, I must tell you
that it is a matter which I trust you will not disappoint me in; indeed, I do
not think that you could be so cruel as to do so. I must also tell you that if
you do, you must prepare to be a great loser, financially speaking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not the faintest idea what you are driving at, uncle,&rdquo; said
Ernest, turning from the glass door to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know you have not. I will tell you. Listen; I will tell you a little
story. Many years ago a great misfortune overtook me, a misfortune so great
that it struck me as lightning sometimes does a tree&mdash;it left the bark
sound, but turned the heart to ashes. Never mind what the details were, they
were nothing out of the common; such things sometimes happen to men and women.
The blow was so severe that it almost turned my brain, so from that day I gave
myself to revenge. It sounds melodramatic, but there was nothing of the sort
about it. I had been cruelly wronged, and I determined that those who had
wronged me should taste of their own medicine. With the exception of one man
they have done so. He has escaped me for a time, but he is doomed. To pass on.
The woman who caused the trouble&mdash;for wherever there is trouble there is
generally a woman who causes it&mdash;had children. Those children are Dorothy
and her brother. I adopted them. As time went on, I grew to love the girl for
her likeness to her mother. The boy I never loved; to this hour I cannot like
him, though he is a gentleman, which his father never was. I can, however,
honestly say that I have done my duty by him. I have told you all this in order
that you may understand the request which I am going to make. I trust to you
never to speak of it, and if you can to forget it. And now for my request
itself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked up wonderingly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is my most earnest desire that you should marry Dorothy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His listener started violently, turned quite pale, and opened his lips to
speak. Mr. Cardus lifted his hand and went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember what I asked you. Pray say nothing; only listen. Of course I
cannot force you into this or any other marriage. I can only beg you to give
heed to my wishes, knowing that they will in every way prove to your advantage.
That girl has a heart of gold; and if you marry her you shall inherit nearly
all my fortune, which is now very large. I have observed that you have lately
been about a great deal with Eva Ceswick. She is a handsome woman, and very
likely has taken some hold upon your fancy. I warn you that any entanglement in
that direction would be most disagreeable to me, and would to a great extent
destroy your prospects, so far as I am concerned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Ernest was about to speak, and again his uncle stopped him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want no confidences, Ernest, and had much rather that no words passed
between us that we might afterwards regret. And now I understand that you are
going abroad with your friend Batty for a couple of months. When you return you
shall give me your answer about Dorothy. In the meanwhile here is a cheque for
your expenses: what is over you can spend as you like. Perhaps you have some
bills to pay.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He gave him a folded cheque, and then went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now leave me, as I am busy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest walked out of the room in a perfect maze. In the yard he mechanically
unfolded the cheque. It was for a large sum&mdash;two hundred and fifty pounds.
He put it in his pocket, and began to reflect upon his position, which was
about as painful as a position can well be. Truly he was on the horns of a
dilemma; probably before he was much older, one of them would have pierced him.
For a moment he was about to return to his uncle and tell him all the truth,
but on reflection he could not see what was to be gained by such a course. At
any rate, it seemed to him that he must first consult Eva, whom he had arranged
to meet on the beach at three o&rsquo;clock; there was nobody else whom he
could consult, for he was shy of talking about Eva to Jeremy or Dolly.
</p>

<p>
The rest of that morning went very ill for Ernest, but three o&rsquo;clock came
at last, and found him at the trysting-place.
</p>

<p>
About a mile on the farther side of Kesterwick, that is, two miles or so from
Titheburgh Abbey, the cliff jutted out into the sea in a way that corresponded
very curiously with the little promontory known as Dum&rsquo;s Ness, the reason
of its resistance to the action of the waves being that it was at this spot
composed of an upcrop of rock of a more durable nature than the sandstone and
pebbles of the remainder of the line of cliff. Just at the point of this
promontory the waves had worn a hollow in the rock that was locally dignified
by the name of the Cave. For two hours or more at high tide this hollow was
under water, and it was, therefore, impossible to pass the headland except by
boat; but during the rest of the day it formed a convenient grotto or
trysting-place, the more so as anybody sitting in it was quite invisible either
from the beach, the cliff above, or indeed, unless the boat was quite close in
shore, the sea in front.
</p>

<p>
Here it was that Ernest had arranged to meet Eva, and on turning the rocky
corner of the cave he found her sitting on a mass of fallen rock waiting for
him. At the sight of her beautiful form he forgot all his troubles, and when
rising to greet him, blushing like the dawn, she lifted her pure face for him
to kiss, there was not a happier lad in England. Then she made room for him
beside her&mdash;the rock was just wide enough for two&mdash;and he placed his
arm round her waist, and for a minute or two she laid her head upon his
shoulder, and they were very happy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are early,&rdquo; he said at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I wanted to get away from Florence and have a good think. You have
no idea how unpleasant she is; she seems to know everything. For instance, she
knew that we went out sailing together last evening, for this morning at
breakfast she said in the most cheerful way that she hoped that I enjoyed my
moonlight sail last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deuce she did! and what did you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I said that I enjoyed it very much, and luckily my aunt did not take any
notice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you not say at once that we were engaged? We <i>are</i> engaged,
you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, I suppose so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose so! There is no supposition about it. At least, if we are not
engaged, what are we?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see, Ernest, it sounds so absurd to say that one is engaged to
a boy! I love you, Ernest, love you dearly, but how can I say that I am engaged
to you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest rose in great wrath. &ldquo;I tell you what it is, Eva, if I am not good
enough to acknowledge, I am not good enough to have anything to do with. A boy,
indeed! I am one-and-twenty; that is full age. Confound it all! you are always
talking about my being so young, just as though I should not get old fast
enough. Can&rsquo;t you wait for me a year or two?&rdquo; he asked, with tears
of mortification in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest, Ernest, do be reasonable, there&rsquo;s a dear; what is the
good of getting angry and making me wretched? Come and sit down here, dear, and
tell me, am <i>I</i> not worth a little patience? There is not the slightest
possibility, so far as I can see, of our getting married at present; so the
question is, if it is of any use to trumpet out an engagement that will only
make us the object of a great deal of gossip, and which, perhaps, your uncle
would not like?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, by Jove!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that reminds me;&rdquo; and sitting
down beside her again, he told her the story of the interview with his uncle.
She listened in silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is all very bad,&rdquo; she said, when he had finished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is bad enough; but what is to be done?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nothing to be done at present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall I make a clean breast of it to him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, no, not now; it will only make matters worse. We must wait, dear.
You must go abroad for a couple of months, as you had arranged, and then when
you come back we must see what can be arranged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, my dearest, I cannot bear to leave you; it makes my heart ache to
think of it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear, I know that it is hard; but it must be done. You could not stop
here now very well without speaking about our&mdash;our engagement, and to do
that would only be to bring your uncle&rsquo;s anger on you. No, you had better
go away, Ernest, and meanwhile I will try to get into Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s good
graces, and, if I fail, then when you come back we must agree upon some plan.
Perhaps by that time you will take your uncle&rsquo;s view of the matter and
want to marry Dorothy. She would make you a better wife than I shall, Ernest,
my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eva, how can you say such things! it is not kind of you!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, why not? It is true. O yes, I know that I am better-looking, and that
is what you men always think of; but she has more brains, more fixity of mind,
and, perhaps, for all I know, more heart than I have, though, for the matter of
that, I feel as if I was all heart just now. Really, Ernest, you had better
transfer your allegiance. Give me up, and forget me, dear; it will save you
much trouble. I know that there is trouble coming; it is in the air. Better
marry Dorothy, and leave me to fight my sorrow out alone. I will release you,
Ernest;&rdquo; and she began to cry at the bare idea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall wait to give you up until you have given me up,&rdquo; said
Ernest, when he had found means to stop her tears; &ldquo;and as for forgetting
you, I can never do that. Please, dear, don&rsquo;t talk so any more; it pains
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well, Ernest; then let us vow eternal fidelity instead; but, my
dear, I <i>know</i> that I shall bring you trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is the price that men have always paid for the smiles of women like
you,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;Trouble may come&mdash;so be it, let it come;
at any rate, I have the consciousness of your love. When I have lost that,
then, and then only, shall I think that I have bought you too dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In the course of his after life these words often came back to Ernest&rsquo;s
mind.

<h2><a name="chap14"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br/>
GOOD-BYE</h2>

<p>
There are some scenes, trivial enough perhaps in themselves, that yet retain a
peculiar power of standing out in sharp relief, as we cast our mind&rsquo;s eye
down the long vista of our past. The group of events with which these
particular scenes were connected may have long ago vanished from our mental
sight, or faded into a dim and misty uniformity, and be as difficult to
distinguish one from the other as the trees of a forest viewed from a height.
But here and there an event, a sensation, or a face will stand out as perfectly
clear as if it had been that moment experienced, felt, or seen. Perhaps it is
only some scene of our childhood, such as a fish darting beneath a rustic
bridge, and the ripple which its motion left upon the water. We have seen many
larger fish dart in many fine rivers since then, and have forgotten them; but
somehow that one little fish has kept awake in the storehouse of our brain,
where most things sleep, though none are really obliterated.
</p>

<p>
It was in this clear and brilliant fashion that every little detail of the
scene was indelibly photographed on Ernest&rsquo;s mind when, on the morning
following their meeting in the cave, he said good-bye to Eva before he went
abroad. It was a public good-bye, for, as it happened, there was no opportunity
for the lovers to meet alone. They were all gathered in the little drawing-room
at the Cottage: Miss Ceswick seated on a straight-backed chair in the
bow-window; Ernest on one side of the round table, looking intensely
uncomfortable; Eva on the other, a scrapbook in her hand, which she studiously
kept before her face; and in the background, leaning carelessly over the back
of a chair in such a way that her own face could not be seen, though she could
survey everybody else&rsquo;s, was Florence. Ernest, from where he sat, could
just make out the outline of her olive face, and the quick glance of her brown
eyes.
</p>

<p>
And so they sat for a long time, but what was said he could not remember; it
was only the scene that imprinted itself upon his memory.
</p>

<p>
And then at last the fatal moment came&mdash;he knew that it was time to go,
and said good-bye to Miss Ceswick, who made some remark about his good fortune
in going to France and Italy, and warned him to be careful not to lose his
heart to a foreign girl. Then he crossed the room and shook hands with
Florence, who smiled coolly in his face, and read him through with her piercing
eyes; and last of all came to Eva, who dropped her album and a
pocket-handkerchief in her confusion as she rose to give him her hand. He
stooped and picked them up&mdash;the album he placed on the table, the little
lace-edged handkerchief he crumpled up in the palm of his left hand and kept;
it was almost the only souvenir he had of her. Then he took her hand, and for a
moment looked into her face. It wore a smile, but beneath it the features were
wan and troubled. It was so hard to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ernest,&rdquo; said Miss Ceswick, &ldquo;you two are taking leave
of each other as solemnly as though you were never going to meet again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps they never will,&rdquo; said Florence, in her clear voice; and
at that moment Ernest felt as though he hated her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You should not croak, Florence; it is unlucky,&rdquo; said Miss Ceswick.
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled.
</p>

<p>
Then Ernest dropped the cold hand, and turning, left the room. Florence
followed him, and, snatching a hat from the pegs, passed into the garden before
him. When he was half-way down the garden-walk, he found her ostensibly picking
some carnations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I want to speak to you for a minute, Ernest,&rdquo; she said;
&ldquo;turn this way with me;&rdquo; and she led him past the bow-window, down
a small shrubbery-walk about twenty paces long. &ldquo;I must offer you my
congratulations,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;I hope that you two will be happy.
Such a handsome pair ought to be happy, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Florence, who told you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Told me! nobody told me. I have seen it all along. Let me see, you first
took a fancy to one another on the night of the Smythes&rsquo; dance, when she
gave you a rose, and the next day you saved her life quite in the romantic and
orthodox way. Well, and then events took their natural course, till one evening
you went out sailing together in a boat. Shall I go on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think it is necessary, Florence, I am sure I don&rsquo;t
know how you know all these things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She had stopped, and was standing slowly picking a carnation to pieces leaf by
leaf.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; she answered, with a laugh. &ldquo;Lovers are
blind; but it does not follow that other people are. I have been thinking,
Ernest, that it is very fortunate that I found out my little mistake before you
discovered yours. Supposing I really had cared for you, the position would have
been awkward now, would it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest was forced to admit that it would.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But luckily, you see, I do not. I am only your true friend now, Ernest;
and it is as a friend that I wish to say a word to you about Eva&mdash;a word
of warning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You love Eva, and Eva loves you, Ernest; but remember this, she is weak
as water. She always was so from a child; those beautiful women often are;
Nature does not give them everything, you see.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What I say, nothing more. She is very weak; and you must not be
surprised if she throws you over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens, Florence! Why, she loves me with all her heart!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but women often think of other things besides their hearts. But
there, I don&rsquo;t want to frighten you, only I would not pin all my faith to
Eva&rsquo;s constancy, however dearly you may think she loves you. Don&rsquo;t
look so distressed, Ernest; I did not wish to pain you. And remember that if
any difficulty should arise between Eva and you, you will always have me on
your side. You will always think of me as your true friend, won&rsquo;t you,
Ernest?&rdquo; and she held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
He took it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed I will,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
They had turned now, and again reached the bow-window, one of the divisions of
which stood open. Florence touched his arm, and pointed into the room. He
looked in through the open window. Miss Ceswick had gone, but Eva was still at
her old place by the table. Her head was down upon the table, resting on the
album he had picked up, and he could see from the motion of her shoulders that
she was sobbing bitterly. Presently she lifted her face&mdash;it was all
stained with tears&mdash;only, however, to drop it again. Ernest made a motion
as though he would enter the house, but Florence stopped him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Best leave her alone,&rdquo; she whispered; and then, when they were
well past the window, added aloud, &ldquo;I am sorry that you saw her like
that; if you should never meet again, or be separated for a very long time, it
will leave a painful recollection in your mind. Well, good-bye. I hope that you
will enjoy yourself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest shook hands in silence&mdash;there was a lump in his throat that
prevented him from speaking&mdash;and then went on his way, feeling utterly
miserable. As for Florence, she put up her hand to shade her keen eyes from the
sun, and watched him till he turned the corner with a look of intense love and
longing, which slowly changed into one of bitter hate. When he was out of sight
she turned, and, making her way to her bedroom, flung herself upon the bed,
and, burying her face in the pillow to stifle the sound of her sobbing, gave
way to an outburst of jealous rage that was almost awful in its intensity.
</p>

<p>
Ernest had only just time to get back to Dum&rsquo;s Ness, and go through the
form of eating some luncheon, before he was obliged to start to catch his
train. Dorothy had packed his things, and made all those little preparations
for his journey that women think of; so, after going to the office to bid
good-bye to his uncle, who shook him heartily by the hand, and bade him not
forget the subject of their conversation, he had nothing to do but jump into
the cart and start. In the sitting-room he found Dorothy waiting for him, with
his coat and gloves, also Jeremy, who was going to drive to the station with
him. He put on his coat in silence; they were all quite silent; indeed, he
might have been going for a long sojourn in a deadly climate, instead of a two
months&rsquo; pleasure-tour, so depressed was everybody.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye, Doll dear,&rdquo; he said, stooping to kiss her; but she
shrank away from him. In another minute he was gone.
</p>

<p>
At the station a word or two about Eva passed between Jeremy and himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ernest,&rdquo; asked the former nervously, &ldquo;have you pulled
it off?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course; who else?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have. But, Jeremy&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want you to say anything about it to anybody at
present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, old fellow,&rdquo; Ernest went on, after a pause, &ldquo;I hope
you don&rsquo;t mind very much.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I said I did not mind, Ernest,&rdquo; he answered, slowly turning his
honest eyes full on to his friend&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;I should be telling a
lie. But I do say this: as I could not win her myself, I am glad that you have,
because next to her I think I love you better than anybody in the world. You
always had the luck, and I wish you joy. There&rsquo;s the train.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest wrung his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, old chap,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;you are a downright good
fellow, and a good friend too. I know I have had the luck, but perhaps it is
going to turn. Good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest&rsquo;s plans were to sleep in London, and to leave on the following
morning, a Wednesday, for Guernsey. There he was to meet his friend on
Thursday, when they were to start upon their tour, first to Normandy, and
thence wherever their fancy led them.
</p>

<p>
This programme he carried out to the letter&mdash;at least the first part of
it. On his way from Liverpool Street Station to the rooms where he had always
slept on the few occasions that he had been in London, his hansom passed down
Fleet Street, and got blocked opposite No. 19. His eye caught the number, and
he wondered what there was about it familiar to him. Then he remembered that 19
Fleet Street was the address of Messrs. Goslings &amp; Sharpe, the bankers on
whom his uncle had given him the cheque for &pound;250. Bethinking himself that
he might as well cash it, he stopped the cab and entered the bank. As he did
so, the cashier was just leaving his desk, for it was past closing hour; but he
courteously took Ernest&rsquo;s cheque, and, though it was for a large sum,
cashed it without hesitation. Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s name was evidently well known
in the establishment. Ernest proceeded on his journey with a crisp little
bundle of Bank of England notes in his breast-pocket, a circumstance that, in
certain events of which at that moment he little dreamed, proved of the utmost
service to him.
</p>

<p>
It will not be necessary for us to follow him in his journey to St.
Peter&rsquo;s Port, which very much resembled other people&rsquo;s journeys. He
arrived there safely enough on Wednesday afternoon, and proceeded to the best
hotel, took a room, and inquired the hour of the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the voyage from Southampton, Ernest had fallen into
conversation with a quiet, foreign-looking man, who spoke English with a
curious little accent. This gentleman&mdash;for there was no doubt about his
being a gentleman&mdash;was accompanied by a boy about nine years of age,
remarkable for his singularly prepossessing face and manners, whom Ernest
rightly judged to be his son. Mr. Alston&mdash;for such he discovered his
companion&rsquo;s name to be&mdash;was a middle-aged man, not possessed of any
remarkable looks or advantages of person, nor in any way brilliant-minded. But
nobody could know Mr. Alston for long without discovering that, his neutral
tints notwithstanding, he was the possessor of an almost striking
individuality. From his open way of talking, Ernest guessed that he was a
colonial; for he had often noticed at college that colonials are much less
reserved than Englishmen proper are bred up to be. He soon learned that Mr.
Alston was a Natal colonist, now, for the first time, paying a visit to the old
country. He had, until lately, held a high position in the Natal Government
service; but having unexpectedly come into a moderate fortune through the death
of an aged lady, a sister of his father in England, he had resigned his
position in the service; and after his short visit &ldquo;home,&rdquo; as
colonists always call the mother country, even when they have never seen it,
intended to start on a big game-shooting expedition in the country between
Secocoeni&rsquo;s country and Delagoa Bay.
</p>

<p>
All this Ernest learned before the boat reached the harbour at St.
Peter&rsquo;s Port, and they separated. He was, however, pleased when, having
seen his luggage put into his room, he went into the little courtyard of the
hotel and found Mr. Alston standing there with his son, and looking rather
puzzled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;I am glad that you have come to this
hotel. Do you want anything?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, yes, I do. The fact of the matter is, I don&rsquo;t understand a
word of French, and I want to find my way to a place that my boy and I have
come over here to see. If they talked Zulu or Sisutu, you see, I should be
equal to the occasion; but to me French is a barbarous tongue, and the people
about here all seem to talk nothing else. Here is the address.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can talk French,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;and, if you like, I will
go with you. The <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i> is not till seven, and it is not six
yet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is very kind of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not at all. I have no doubt that you would show me the way about
Zululand, if ever I wandered there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, that I would, with pleasure;&rdquo; and they started.
</p>

<p>
It was with considerable difficulty that Ernest discovered the place Mr. Alston
was in search of. Finally, however, he found it. It was a quaint out-of-the-way
little street, very narrow and crooked, an odd mixture of old private houses
and shops, most of which seemed to deal in soap and candles. At last they came
to No. 36, a gray old house standing in its own grounds. Mr. Alston scanned it
eagerly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is the place,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;she often told me of the
coat-of-arms over the doorway&mdash;a mullet impaled with three squirrels;
there they are. I wonder if it is still a school?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It turned out that it was still a school, and in due course they were admitted,
and allowed to wander round the ancient walled garden, with every nook of which
Mr. Alston seemed to be perfectly acquainted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is the tree under which she used to sit,&rdquo; he said sadly to
his boy, pointing out an old yew-tree, under which there stood a rotting bench.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who?&rdquo; asked Ernest, much interested.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dead wife, that boy&rsquo;s mother; she was educated here,&rdquo; he
said, with a sigh. &ldquo;There, I have seen it. Let us go.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap15"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br/>
ERNEST GETS INTO TROUBLE</h2>

<p>
When Mr. Alston and Ernest reached the hotel, there was still a quarter of an
hour to elapse before the <i>table d&rsquo;hôte</i>, so, after washing his
hands and putting on a black coat, Ernest went down into the coffee-room. There
was only one other person in it, a tall fair Frenchwoman, apparently about
thirty years of age. She was standing by the empty fireplace, her arm upon the
mantelpiece, and a lace pocket-handkerchief in her hand; and Ernest&rsquo;s
first impression of her was that she was handsome and much over-dressed. There
was a newspaper upon the mantelpiece, which he desired to get possession of. As
he advanced for this purpose, the lady dropped her handkerchief. Stooping down,
he picked it out of the grate and handed it to her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mille remerciments, monsieur,</i>&rdquo; she said, with a little
curtsey.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Du tout, madame.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Ah, monsieur parle fran&ccedil;ais?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Mais oui, madame.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then they drifted into a conversation, in the course of which Ernest
learned that madame thought St. Peter&rsquo;s Port very dull; that she had been
there three days with her friends, and was nearly dead <i>de tristesse;</i>
that she was going, however, to the public dance at the &ldquo;Hall&rdquo; that
night. &ldquo;Of course monsieur would be there;&rdquo; and many other things,
for madame had a considerable command of language.
</p>

<p>
In the middle of all this the door opened, and another lady of much the same
cut as madame entered, followed by two young men. The first of these had a face
of the commonplace English type, rather a good-humoured face; but when he saw
the second, Ernest started, it was so like his own, as his would become if he
were to spend half a dozen years in drinking, dicing, late hours, and their
concomitants. The man to whom this face belonged was evidently a gentleman, but
he looked an ill-tempered one, and very puny and out of health; at least so
thought Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is time for dinner, Camille,&rdquo; said the gentleman to madame, at
the same time favouring Ernest with a most comprehensive scowl.
</p>

<p>
Madame appeared not to understand, and made some remark to Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is time for dinner, Camille,&rdquo; said the gentleman again, in a
savage voice. This time she lifted her head and looked at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Din-nare, dinnare!</i> qu&rsquo;est-que c&rsquo;est que
<i>din-nare?</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Table d&rsquo;hôte,</i>&rdquo; said the gentleman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, pardon;&rdquo; and with a little bow and most fascinating smile to
Ernest, she took the gentleman&rsquo;s extended arm and sailed away.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you pretend not to understand me?&rdquo; Ernest heard him ask,
and saw her shrug her shoulders in reply. The other gentleman followed with his
companion, and after him came Ernest. When he reached the <i>salle-à-manger</i>
he found that the only chair vacant at the table was one next to his friend of
the <i>salon.</i> Indeed, had he thought of it, it might have struck him that
madame had contrived to keep that chair vacant, for on his approach she
gathered together the folds of her silk dress, which had almost hidden it, and
welcomed him with a little nod.
</p>

<p>
Ernest took the chair, and forthwith madame entered into a most lively
conversation with him, a course of proceeding that appeared to be extremely
distasteful to the gentleman on her right, who pished and pshawed and pushed
away his plate in a manner that soon became quite noticeable. But madame talked
serenely on, quite careless of his antics, till at last he whispered something
to her that caused the blood to mount to her fair cheek.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mais tais-toi, donc,&rdquo; Ernest heard her answer, and next
moment&mdash;the subsequent history of our hero demands that the truth should
be told&mdash;it was his turn to colour, for, alas! there was no doubt about
it, he distinctly felt madame&rsquo;s little foot pressed upon his own. He took
up his wine and drank a little to hide his confusion; but whether he had or had
not the moral courage to withdraw from the situation, by placing his toes under
the more chilly but safe guardianship of the chair-legs, history saith not; let
us hope and presume that he had. But if this was so or not he did not get on
very well with his dinner, for the situation was novel and not conducive to
appetite. Presently Mr. Alston, who was sitting opposite, addressed him across
the table.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you going to the dance here to-night, Mr. Kershaw?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
To Ernest&rsquo;s surprise, the gentleman on the other side of madame answered,
with an astonished look:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I am going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, &ldquo;I was speaking to the
gentleman on your left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, indeed! I thought you said Kershaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I did; the gentleman&rsquo;s name is Kershaw, I think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; put in Ernest, &ldquo;my name is Kershaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is odd,&rdquo; said the other gentleman, &ldquo;so is mine. I did
not know that there were any other Kershaws.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nor did I,&rdquo; answered Ernest, &ldquo;except Sir Hugh
Kershaw;&rdquo; and his face darkened as he pronounced the name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am Sir Hugh Kershaw&rsquo;s son; my name is Hugh Kershaw,&rdquo; was
the reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! Then we are cousins, I suppose; for I am his nephew, the son of
his brother Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Hugh Kershaw the elder did not receive this intelligence with even the moderate
amount of enthusiasm that might have been expected; he simply lifted his scanty
eyebrows, and said, &ldquo;Oh, I remember, my uncle left a son;&rdquo; then he
turned and made some remark to the gentleman who sat next him that made the
latter laugh.
</p>

<p>
Ernest felt the blood rise to his cheeks; there was something very insolent
about his cousin&rsquo;s tone.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards the dinner came to an end, and madame, with another
fascinating smile, retired. As for Ernest, he smoked a pipe with Mr. Alston,
and about nine o&rsquo;clock strolled over with him to the Hall, or Assembly
Rooms, a building largely composed of glass, where thrice a week, during the
season, the visitors at St. Peter&rsquo;s Port adjourned to dance, flirt, and
make merry.
</p>

<p>
One of the first sights that caught his eye was a fair creature in
evening-dress, and with conspicuously white shoulders, in whom he recognised
madame. She was sitting near the door, and appeared to be watching it. Ernest
bowed to her, and was about to pass on; but, pursuing her former tactics, she
dropped the bouquet she was carrying. He stooped, picked it up, returned it,
and again made as though he would pass on, when she addressed him, just as the
band struck up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, que c&rsquo;est belle, la musique! Monsieur valse, n&rsquo;est-ce
pas?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In another minute they were floating down the room together. As they passed
along, Ernest saw his cousin standing in the corner, looking at him with no
amiable air. Madame saw his glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;Monsieur Hugh ne valse pas, il se grise; il
a l&rsquo;air jaloux, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest danced three times with this fair enslaver, and with their last waltz
the ball came to an end. Just then his cousin came up, and they all, including
Mr. Alston, walked together along the steep streets, which were now quite
deserted, to the door of the hotel. Here Ernest said good-night to madame, who
extended her hand. He took it, and as he did so he felt a note slipped into it,
which, not being accustomed to such transactions, he clumsily dropped. It was
the ball programme, and there was something written across it in pencil.
Unfortunately, he was not the only one who saw this; his cousin Hugh, who had
evidently been drinking, saw it too, and tried to pick up the programme, but
Ernest was too quick for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give me that,&rdquo; said his cousin, hoarsely.
</p>

<p>
Ernest answered by putting it into his pocket.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is written on that programme?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What have you written on that programme, Camille?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mon Dieu, mais vous m&rsquo;ennuyez!&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I insist upon your giving me that!&rdquo; with an oath.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Monsieur est <i>gentleman!</i> Monsieur ne la rendra pas,&rdquo; said
madame, with a meaning glance; and then turning, she entered the hotel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not going to give it to you,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall give it to me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is this lady your wife?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is my affair; give me that note.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall not give it to you,&rdquo; said Ernest, whose temper was rapidly
rising. &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what is on it, and I don&rsquo;t wish to
know; but whatever it is, the lady gave it to me, and not to you. She is not
your wife, and you have no right to ask for it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His cousin Hugh turned livid with fury. At the best of times he was an
evil-tempered man; and now, inflamed as he was by drink and jealousy, he looked
a perfect fiend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Damn you!&rdquo; he hissed, &ldquo;you half-bred cur; I suppose that you
get your &mdash;&mdash; manners from your &mdash;&mdash; of a mother!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not get any further; for at this point Ernest knocked him into the
gutter, and then stood over him, very quiet and pale, and told him that if ever
he dared to let a disrespectful word about his mother pass his lips again, he
(Ernest) would half-kill him (Hugh). Then he let him get up.
</p>

<p>
Hugh Kershaw rose, and turning, whispered something to his friend, who had sat
next him at dinner, a man about thirty years of age, and with a military air
about him. His friend listened, and pulled his large moustache thoughtfully.
Then he addressed Ernest with the utmost politeness:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am Captain Justice, of the &mdash;&mdash; Hussars. Of course, Mr. Kershaw, you
are aware that you cannot indulge yourself in the luxury of knocking people
down without hearing more about it. Have you any friend with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest shook his head as he answered: &ldquo;This,&rdquo; indicating Mr.
Alston, who had been an attentive observer of everything that had passed,
&ldquo;is the only gentleman I know in the town, and I cannot ask him to mix
himself up in my quarrels.&rdquo; Ernest was beginning to understand that this
quarrel was a very serious business.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, my lad,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston quietly, &ldquo;I will stand
by you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, I have no right&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; began Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! It is one of our colonial customs to stick by one
another.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Justice&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Justice,&rdquo; put in that gentleman, with a bow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Captain Justice, my name is Alston. I am very much at your
service.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Captain Justice turned to Hugh Kershaw, whose clothes were dripping from the
water in the gutter, and after whispering with him for a moment, said aloud,
&ldquo;If I were you, Kershaw, I should go and change those clothes; you will
catch cold.&rdquo; And then, addressing Mr. Alston, &ldquo;I think the
smoking-room is empty. Shall we go and have a chat?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston assented, and they went in together. Ernest followed; but having lit
his pipe, sat down in a far corner of the room. Presently Mr. Alston called
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Kershaw, this is a serious business, and as you are
principally concerned, I think that you had better give your own answer. To be
brief, your cousin, Mr. Hugh Kershaw, demands that you should apologise in
writing for having struck him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am willing to do that if he will apologise for the terms he used in
connection with my mother.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; said the gallant Captain, &ldquo;the young gentleman is
coming to reason.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He also demands that you should hand over the note you received from the
lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That I certainly shall not do,&rdquo; he answered; and drawing the card
from his pocket, he tore it into fragments, unread.
</p>

<p>
Captain Justice bowed and left the room. In a few minutes he returned, and,
addressing Mr. Alston and Ernest, said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Kershaw is not satisfied with what you offer to do. He declines to
apologise for any expression that he may have used with reference to your
mother, and he now wishes you to choose between signing an apology, which I
shall dictate, or meeting him to-morrow morning. You must remember that we are
in Guernsey, where you cannot insult a man on the payment of forty
shillings.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Of course, this view was an entirely incorrect one. Although Guernsey has a
political constitution of its own, many of its laws being based upon the old
Norman-French customs, and judicial proceedings being carried on in French,
&amp;c., it is quite as criminal an act to fight a duel there as in England, as
Captain Justice himself afterwards found out to his cost. But they none of them
knew that.
</p>

<p>
Ernest felt the blood run to his heart. He understood now what Captain Justice
meant. He answered simply:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be very happy to meet my cousin in whatever place and way you
and Mr. Alston may agree upon;&rdquo; and then he returned to his chair, and
gave himself up to the enjoyment of his pipe and an entirely new set of
sensations.
</p>

<p>
Captain Justice gazed after him pityingly. &ldquo;I am sorry for him,&rdquo; he
said to Mr. Alston. &ldquo;Kershaw is, I believe, a good shot with pistols. I
suppose you will choose pistols. It would be difficult to get swords in such a
hurry. He is a fine young fellow. Took it coolly, by George! Well, I
don&rsquo;t think that he will trouble the world much longer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a silly business, and likely to land us all in a nasty mess. Is
there no way out of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;None that I know of, unless your young friend will eat dirt. He is a
nasty-tempered fellow, Kershaw, and wild about that woman, over whom he has
spent thousands. Nor is he likely to forgive being rolled in the gutter. You
had better get your man to give in, for if you don&rsquo;t, Kershaw will kill
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is no good talking of it. I have lived a rough life, and know what
men are made of. He is not of that sort. Besides, your man is in the wrong, not
that boy. If anybody spoke of my mother like that, I would shoot him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good, Mr. Alston. And now about the pistols; I have none.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have a pair of Smith &amp; Wesson revolvers that I bought yesterday to
take out to Africa with me. They throw a very heavy bullet, Captain
Justice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too heavy. If one of them is hit anywhere in the body&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo; He
did not finish the sentence.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston nodded. &ldquo;We must put them twenty paces apart, to give them a
chance of missing. And now about the place and the time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know a place on the beach, about a mile and a half from here, that
will do very well. You go down that street till you strike the beach, then turn
to your right, and follow the line of the sea till you come to a deserted hut
or cottage. There we will meet you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At what time?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me see; shall we say a quarter to five? It will be light enough for
us then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. The Weymouth boat leaves at half-past six. I am going to see
about getting my things ready to go to meet it. I should advise you to do the
same, Captain Justice. We had better not return here after it is over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And then they parted.
</p>

<p>
Luckily the manager of the hotel had not gone to bed; so the various parties
concerned were able to pay their bills, and make arrangements about their
luggage being sent to meet the early boat, without exciting the slightest
suspicion. Ernest wrote a note, and left it to be given to his friend when he
should arrive on the morrow, in which he stated mysteriously that business had
called him away. He could not help smiling to himself sadly when he thought
that his business might be of a sort that it would take all eternity to settle.
</p>

<p>
Then he went to his room and wrote two letters, one to Eva and one to Dorothy.
Mr. Alston was to post them if anything happened to him. The first was of a
passionate nature, and breathed hopes of reunion in another place&mdash;ah, how
fondly the poor human heart clings to that idea!&mdash;the second collected and
sensible enough. The letters finished, following Mr. Alston&rsquo;s advice, he
undressed and took a bath; then he said his prayers&mdash;the prayers his
mother had taught him&mdash;put on a quiet dark suit of clothes, and went and
sat by the open window.
</p>

<p>
The night was very still and fragrant with the sweet strong breath of the sea.
Not a sound came from the quaint old town beneath&mdash;all was at peace.
Ernest, sitting there, wondered whether he would live to see another night,
and, if not, what the nights were like in the land whither he was journeying.
And as he thought of it the gray damps that hide that unrisen world from our
gaze struck into his soul and made him feel afraid. Not afraid of death, but
afraid of the empty loneliness beyond it&mdash;of the cold air of an infinite
space in which nothing human can live. Would his mother meet him there, he
wondered, or would she put him from her, coming with blood upon his hands. And
then he thought of Eva, and in his solitude a tear gathered in his dark eyes.
It seemed so hard to go to that other place without her.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap16"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br/>
MADAME&rsquo;S WORK</h2>

<p>
Presently the eastern sky began to be barred with rays of light, and Ernest
knew that the dawn was near.
</p>

<p>
Rising with a sigh, he made his last preparations, inwardly determining that,
if he was to die, he would die in a way befitting an English gentleman. There
should be no sign of his fears on his face when he looked at his
adversary&rsquo;s pistol.
</p>

<p>
Presently there came a soft knock at the door, and Mr. Alston entered with his
shoes off. In his hand he held a case containing the two Smith &amp; Wessons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We must be off presently,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I just heard Captain
Justice go down. Look here, Kershaw, do you understand anything about
these?&rdquo; and he tapped the Smith &amp; Wessons.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I have often practised with a pair of old duelling-pistols at home.
I used to be a very fair shot with them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is lucky. Now take one of these revolvers; I want to give you a
lesson, and accustom you to handle it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I will not. It would not be fair on the other man. If I did, and
killed him, I should feel like a murderer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As you like; but I am going to tell you something, and give you a bit of
advice. These revolvers are hair-triggered; I had the scears filed. When the
word is given, bring the barrel of your pistol <i>down</i> till you get the
sight well on to your antagonist somewhere about his chest, then <i>press</i>
the trigger, do not pull it, remember that. If you do as I tell you, he will
never hear the report. Above all, do not lose your nerve; and don&rsquo;t be
sentimental and fire in the air, or any such nonsense, for that is a most
futile proceeding, morally, and in every other way. Mark my words, if you do
not kill him, he will kill you. He intends to kill you, and you are in the
right. Now we must be going. Your luggage is in the hall, is it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All except this bag.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good; bring it down with you. My boy will bring it to the boat with
my own. If you are not hit, you will do well to get out of this as soon as
possible. I mean to make for Southampton as straight as I can. There is a
vessel sailing for South Africa on Friday morning; I shall embark in her. We
will settle what you are to do afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Ernest, with a smile, &ldquo;there is no need to talk
of that at present.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Five minutes afterwards they met in the hall, and slipped quietly out through
the door that always stood open all night for the accommodation of visitors
addicted to late hours. Following the street that Captain Justice had pointed
out, they descended to the beach, and, turning to the right, walked along it
leisurely. The early morning air was very sweet, and all nature smiled dimly
upon them as they went, for the sun was not yet up; but at that moment Ernest
did not think much of the beauty of the morning. It all seemed like a frightful
dream. At last they came to the deserted hut, looming large in the gray mist.
By it stood two figures.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They are there already,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston.
</p>

<p>
As they approached the two figures lifted their hats, a compliment which they
returned. Then Mr. Alston went to Captain Justice, and fell into conversation
with him, and together they paced off a certain distance on the sand, marking
its limits with their walking-sticks. Ernest noticed that it was about the
length of a short cricket-pitch.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we place them?&rdquo; he heard Captain Justice say.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not just yet,&rdquo; was the reply; &ldquo;there is barely light
enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, gentlemen,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston presently, &ldquo;I have prepared
in duplicate a paper setting forth as fairly as I can the circumstances under
which this unhappy affair has come about. I propose to read it to you, and to
ask you all to sign it, as a protection to&mdash;to us all. I have brought a
pen and a pocket ink-pot with me for that purpose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nobody objected, so he read the paper. It was short, concise, and just, and
they all signed it as it stood. Ernest&rsquo;s hand shook a good deal as he did
so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, that won&rsquo;t do,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, encouragingly, as he
pocketed one copy of the document after handing the other to Captain Justice.
&ldquo;Shake yourself together, man!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But for all his brave words he looked the more nervous of the two.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish to say,&rdquo; began Ernest, addressing himself to all the other
three, &ldquo;that this quarrel is none of my seeking. I could not in honour
give up the note the lady wrote to me. But I feel that this is a dreadful
business; and if you,&rdquo; addressing his cousin, &ldquo;are ready to
apologise for what you said about my mother, I am ready to do the same for
attacking you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Hugh Kershaw smiled bitterly, and, turning, said something to his second.
Ernest caught the words &ldquo;white feather.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Hugh Kershaw refuses to offer any apology; he expects one,&rdquo;
was Captain Justice&rsquo;s ready answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then if any blood is shed, on his head be it!&rdquo; said Mr. Alston
solemnly. &ldquo;Come, let us get it over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Each took his man and placed him by one of the sticks, and then handed him a
revolver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stand sideways, and remember what I told you,&rdquo; whispered Mr.
Alston.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Are you ready, gentlemen?&rdquo; asked Captain Justice presently.
</p>

<p>
There was no answer; but Ernest felt his heart stand still, and a mist gathered
before his eyes. At that moment he heard a lark rise into the air near him and
begin to sing. Unless he could get his sight back he felt that he was lost.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>One!</i>&rdquo; The mist cleared away from his eyes; he saw his
adversary&rsquo;s pistol-barrel pointing steadily at him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Two!</i>&rdquo; A ray broke from the rising sun, and caught a crystal
pin Hugh Kershaw incautiously wore. Instinctively Ernest remembered Mr.
Alston&rsquo;s advice, and lowered the sight of his long barrel till it was
dead on the crystal pin. Curiously enough, it reminded him at the moment of the
eyes in the witch&rsquo;s head at Dum&rsquo;s Ness. His vital forces rose to
the emergency, and his arm grew as steady as a rock. Then came a pause that
seemed hours long.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Three!</i>&rdquo; There was a double report, and Ernest became aware
of a commotion in his hair. Hugh Kershaw flung up his arms wildly, sprang a few
inches off the ground, and fell backwards. Great God, it was over!
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus05"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig05.jpg" width="413" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Hugh Kershaw flung up his arms, wildly.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
Ernest staggered a moment from the reaction, and then ran with the others
towards his cousin&mdash;nay, towards what had been his cousin. He was lying on
his back upon the sand, his wide-opened eyes staring up at the blue sky, as
though to trace the flight of the spirit, his arms extended. The heavy
revolver-ball had struck near the crystal pin, and then passed upwards through
the throat and out at the base of the head, shattering the spinal column.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is dead,&rdquo; said Captain Justice, solemnly.
</p>

<p>
Ernest wrung his hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have killed him,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;I have killed my own
cousin!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Young man,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, &ldquo;do not stand there wringing
your hands, but thank Providence for your own escape. He was very near killing
you, let me tell you. Is your head cut?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Instinctively Ernest took off his hat, and as he did so some fragments of his
curly hair fell to the ground. There was a neat hole through the felt, and a
neat groove along his thick hair. His cousin had meant to kill him; and he was
a good shot&mdash;so good that he thought that he could put a ball through
Ernest&rsquo;s head. But he forgot that a heavy American revolver, with forty
grains of powder behind the ball, is apt to throw a trifle high.
</p>

<p>
And then they all stood silent and looked at the body; and the lark, that had
been frightened by the noise, began to sing again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This will not do,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston presently. &ldquo;We had better
move the body in there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the deserted hut.
&ldquo;Captain Justice, what do you intend to do?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Give myself up to the authorities, I suppose,&rdquo; was the gallant
Captain&rsquo;s scared answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very well. I don&rsquo;t advise you to do that, but if you are
determined to, there is no need for you to be in a hurry about it. You must
give us time to get clear first.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They lifted the corpse, reverently bore it into the deserted hut, and laid it
on the floor. Ernest remained standing looking at the red stain where it had
been. Presently they came out again, and Mr. Alston kicked some sand over the
stain and hid it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;we had better make an addition to those
documents, to say how this came about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They all went back to the hut, and the addition was made, standing there by the
body. When it came to Ernest&rsquo;s turn to sign, he almost wished that his
signature was the one missing from the foot of that ghastly post-scriptum. Mr.
Alston guessed his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The fortune of war,&rdquo; he said, coolly. &ldquo;Now, Captain Justice,
we are going to catch the early boat, and we hope that you will not give
yourself up before midday, if you can help it. The inquiry into the affair will
not then be held before to-morrow; and by eleven to-morrow morning I hope to
have seen the last of England for some years to come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Captain was a good fellow at bottom, and had no wish to see others dragged
into trouble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall certainly give myself up,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;but I
don&rsquo;t see any reason to hurry about it. I don&rsquo;t think that they can
do much to me here. Poor Hugh! he can well afford to wait,&rdquo; he added,
with a sigh, glancing down at the figure that lay so still, with a coat thrown
over the face. &ldquo;I suppose that they will lock me up for six
months&mdash;pleasant prospect! But I say, Mr. Kershaw, you had better keep
clear; it will be more awkward for you. You see, he was your cousin, and by his
death you become, unless I am mistaken, next heir to the title.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so,&rdquo; said Ernest, vaguely.
</p>

<p>
Here it may be stated that Captain Justice found himself sadly mistaken.
Instead of the six months he expected, he was arraigned for murder, and finally
sentenced to a term of penal servitude. He received a pardon, however, after
serving about a year of his time.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, we must be off,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, &ldquo;or we shall be late
for the boat;&rdquo; and, bowing to Captain Justice, he left the hut.
</p>

<p>
Ernest followed his example, and, when he had gone a few yards, glanced round
at the hateful spot. There stood Captain Justice in the doorway of the hut,
looking much depressed, and there, a few yards to the left, was the impress in
the sand that marked where his cousin had fallen. He never saw either the man
or the place again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Kershaw,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, &ldquo;what do you propose
doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But you must think; remember you are in an awkward fix. You know by
English law duelling is murder; and now I come to think of it, I expect that
this place is subject to the English law in criminal matters, or at least that
the law is identical.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think I had better give myself up, like Captain Justice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense. You must hide away somewhere for a year or two till the row
blows over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where am I to hide?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any money, or can you get any?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I have nearly two hundred and fifty pounds on me now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word, that is fortunate! Well, now, what I have to suggest is, that
you should assume a false name, and sail for South Africa with me. I am going
up-country on a shooting expedition, outside British territory, so there will
be little fear of your being caught and extradited. Then, in a year or so, when
the affair is forgotten, you can come back to England. What do you say to
that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose I may as well go there as anywhere else. I shall be a marked
man all my life, anyhow. What does it matter where I go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you are down on your luck now; by-and-by you will cheer up
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then they met a fisherman, who gazed at them, wondering what the two
gentlemen were doing out walking at that hour; but concluding that, after the
mad fashion of Englishmen, they had been to bathe, he passed them with a civil
&ldquo;Bonjour.&rdquo; Ernest coloured to the eyes under the scrutiny; he was
beginning to feel the dreadful burden of his secret. Presently they reached the
steamer, and found Mr. Alston&rsquo;s little boy Roger, who, though he was only
nine years old, was as quick and self-reliant as many English lads of fourteen,
waiting for them by the bridge.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, here you are, father; you have been walking so long that I thought
you would miss the boat. I have brought the luggage down all right, and this
gentleman&rsquo;s too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right, my lad. Kershaw, do you go and take the tickets; I
want to get rid of this;&rdquo; and he tapped the revolver-case, that was
concealed beneath his coat.
</p>

<p>
Ernest did so, and presently met Mr. Alston on the boat. A few minutes more
and, to his intense relief, she cast off and stood out to sea. There were not
very many passengers on board, and those there were, were too much taken up in
making preparations to be sea-sick to take any notice of Ernest. And yet he
could not shake himself free from the idea that everybody knew that he had just
killed a man. His own self-consciousness was so intense that he saw his guilt
reflected on the faces of all he met. He gazed around him in awe, expecting
every moment to be greeted as a murderer. Most people who have ever done
anything they should not are acquainted with this sensation. Overcome with this
idea, he took refuge in his berth, nor did he emerge therefrom till the boat
reached Weymouth. There both he and Mr. Alston bought some rough clothes, and,
to a great extent, succeeded in disguising themselves; then made their way
across country to Southampton in the same trains, but in separate compartments.
Reaching Southampton without let or hindrance, they agreed to take passages in
the Union Company&rsquo;s R.M.S. <i>Moor,</i> sailing on the following morning.
Mr. Alston obtained a list of the passengers; fortunately, there was nobody
among them whom he knew. For greater security, however, they took steerage
passages, and booked themselves under assumed names. Ernest took his second
Christian name, and figured on the passenger list as E. Beyton, while Mr.
Alston and his boy assumed the name of James. They took their passages at
different times, and feigned to be unknown to each other. These precautions
they found to be doubly necessary, inasmuch as at Southampton Mr. Alston
managed to get hold of a book on English criminal law, from which it appeared
that the fact of the duel having been fought at Guernsey did not in the least
clear them from the legal consequences of the act, as they had vaguely supposed
would be the case, on the insufficient authority of Captain Justice&rsquo;s
statement.
</p>

<p>
At last the vessel sailed, and it was with a sigh of relief that Ernest saw his
native shores fade from view. As they disappeared, a fellow-passenger, valet to
a gentleman going to the Cape for his health, politely offered him a paper to
read. It was the <i>Standard</i> of that day&rsquo;s date. He took it and
glanced at the foreign intelligence. The first thing that caught his eye was
the following paragraph, headed &ldquo;A Fatal Duel&rdquo;:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The town of St. Peter&rsquo;s in Guernsey has been thrown into a state
of consternation by the discovery of the body of an English gentleman, who was
this morning shot dead in a duel. Captain Justice, of the &mdash;&mdash; Hussars, who
was the unfortunate gentleman&rsquo;s second, has surrendered himself to the
authorities. The other parties, who are at present unknown, have absconded. It
is said that they have been traced to Weymouth; but there all trace of them has
been lost. The cause of the duel is unknown, and in the present state of
excitement it is difficult to obtain authentic information.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By the pilot who left the vessel Ernest despatched two letters, one to Eva
Ceswick, and the other&mdash;which contained a copy of the memoranda drawn up
before and after the duel, and attested by Mr. Alston&mdash;to his uncle. To
both he told the story of his misfortune, fully and fairly, imploring the
former not to forget him and to wait for happier times, and asking the
forgiveness of the latter for the trouble that he had brought upon himself and
all belonging to him. Should they wish to write to him, he gave his address as
Ernest Beyton, Post-office, Maritzburg.
</p>

<p>
The pilot-boat hoisted her brown sail with a huge white P. upon it and vanished
into the night; and Ernest, feeling that he was a ruined man, and with the
stain of blood upon his hands, crept to his bunk and wept like a child.
</p>

<p>
Yesterday he had been loved, prosperous, happy, with a bright career before
him. To-day he was a nameless outcast, departing into exile, and his young life
shadowed by a cloud in which he could see no break.
</p>

<p>
Well might he weep; it was a hard lesson.

MY POOR EVA</h2>

<p>
Two days after the pilot-boat, flitting away from the vessel&rsquo;s side like
some silent-flighted bird, had vanished into the night, Florence Ceswick
happened to be walking past the village post-office on her way to pay a visit
to Dorothy, when it struck her that the afternoon post must be in, and that she
might as well ask if there were any letters for Dum&rsquo;s Ness. There was no
second delivery at Kesterwick, and she knew that it was not always convenient
to Mr. Cardus to send in. The civil old postmaster gave her a little bundle of
letters, remarking at the same time that he thought that there was one for the
Cottage.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is it for me, Mr. Brown?&rdquo; asked Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, miss; it is for Miss Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, then I will leave it; I am going up to Dum&rsquo;s Ness. No doubt
Miss Eva will call.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She knew that Eva watched the arrival of the posts very carefully. When she got
outside the office she glanced at the bundle of letters in her hand, and
noticed with a start that one of them, addressed to Mr. Cardus, was in
Ernest&rsquo;s handwriting. It bore a Southampton post-mark. What, she
wondered, could he be doing at Southampton? He should have been in Guernsey.
</p>

<p>
She walked on briskly to Dum&rsquo;s Ness, and on her arrival found Dorothy
sitting working in the sitting-room. After she had greeted her she handed over
the letters.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is one from Ernest,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, I am so glad!&rdquo; answered Dorothy. &ldquo;Who is it for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For Mr. Cardus. O, here he comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus shook hands with her, and thanked her for bringing the letters,
which he turned over casually, after the fashion of a man accustomed to receive
large quantities of correspondence of an uninteresting nature. Presently his
manner quickened, and he opened Ernest&rsquo;s letter. Florence fixed her keen
eyes upon him. He read the letter; she read his face.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus was accustomed to conceal his emotions, but on this occasion it was
clear that they were too strong for him. Astonishment and grief pursued each
other across his features as he proceeded. Finally he put the letter down and
glanced at an enclosure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, Reginald, what is it?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; answered Mr. Cardus solemnly, &ldquo;that Ernest is a
murderer and a fugitive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy sank into a chair with a groan, and covered her face with her hands.
Florence turned ashy pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Read the letter for yourself, and see. Stop, read it aloud, and the
enclosure too. I may have misunderstood.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence did so in a quiet voice. It was wonderful how her power came out in
contrast to the intense disturbance of the other two. The old man of the world
shook like a leaf, the young girl stood firm as a rock. Yet, in all
probability, her interest in Ernest was more intense than his.
</p>

<p>
When she had finished, Mr. Cardus spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I was right. He is a murderer and an
outcast. And I loved the boy, I loved him. Well, let him go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest, Ernest!&rdquo; sobbed Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Florence glanced from one to the other with contempt.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you talking about?&rdquo; she said at last. &ldquo;What is
there to make all this fuss about? &lsquo;Murderer,&rsquo; indeed! Then our
grandfathers were often murderers. What would you have had him do? Would you
have had him give up the woman&rsquo;s letter to save himself? Would you have
had him put up with this other man&rsquo;s insults about his mother? If he had,
I would never have spoken to him again. Stop that groaning, Dorothy. You should
be proud of him; he behaved as a gentleman should. If I had the right I should
be proud of him;&rdquo; and her breast heaved and the proud lips curled as she
said it.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus listened attentively, and it was evident that her enthusiasm moved
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is something in what Florence says,&rdquo; he broke in. &ldquo;I
should not have liked the boy to show the white feather. But it is an awful
business to kill one&rsquo;s own first cousin, especially when one is next in
the entail. Old Kershaw will be furious at losing his only son, and Ernest will
never be able to come back to this country while he lives, or he will set the
law on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is dreadful!&rdquo; said Dorothy; &ldquo;just as he was beginning
life, and going into a profession, and now to have to go and wander in that
far-off country under a false name!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, it is sad enough,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus; &ldquo;but what is done
cannot be undone. He is young, and will live it down, and if the worst comes to
the worst, must make himself a home out there. But it is hard upon me, hard
upon me;&rdquo; and he went off to his office, muttering, &ldquo;hard upon
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When Florence started upon her homeward way, the afternoon had set in wet and
chilly, and the sea was hidden in wreaths of gray mist. Altogether the scene
was depressing. On arrival at the Cottage she found Eva standing, the picture
of melancholy, by the window, and staring out at the misty sea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Florence, I am glad that you have come home; I really began to feel
inclined to commit suicide.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! and may I ask why?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know; the rain is so depressing, I suppose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It does not depress me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, nothing ever does; you live in the land of perpetual calm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I take exercise, and keep my liver in good order. Have you been out this
afternoon?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I thought not. No wonder you feel depressed, staying indoors all
day. Why don&rsquo;t you go for a walk?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is nowhere to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Eva, I don&rsquo;t know what has come to you lately, why
don&rsquo;t you go along the cliff, or stop&mdash;have you been to the
post-office? I called for the Dum&rsquo;s Ness letters, and Mr. Brown said that
there was one for you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva jumped up with remarkable animation, and passed out of the room with her
peculiar light tread. The mention of that word &ldquo;letter&rdquo; had
sufficed to change the aspect of things considerably.
</p>

<p>
Florence watched her go with a dark little smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; she said aloud, as the door closed, &ldquo;your feet will
soon fall heavily enough.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently Eva went out, and Florence, having thrown off her cloak, took her
sister&rsquo;s place at the window and waited. It was seven minutes&rsquo; walk
to the post-office. She would be back in about a quarter of an hour. Watch in
hand, Florence waited patiently. Seventeen minutes had elapsed when the
garden-gate was opened, and Eva re-entered, her face quite gray with pain, and
furtively applying a handkerchief to her eyes. Florence smiled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought so,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
From all of which it will be seen that Florence was a very remarkable woman.
She had scarcely exaggerated when she said that her heart was as deep as the
sea. The love that she bore Ernest was the strongest thing in all her strong
and vigorous life; when every other characteristic and influence crumbled away
and was forgotten, it would still remain overmastering as ever. And when she
discovered that her high love, the greatest and best part of her, had been made
a plaything of by a thoughtless boy, who kissed girls on the same principle
that a duck takes to water, because it came natural to him, the love in its
mortal agonies gave birth to a hate destined to grow great as itself. But, with
all a woman&rsquo;s injustice, it was not directed towards the same object. On
Ernest, indeed, she would wreak vengeance if she could, but she still loved him
as dearly as at first; the revenge would be a mere episode in the history of
her passion. But to her sister, the innocent woman who, she chose to consider,
had robbed her, she gave all that bountiful hate. Herself the more powerful
character of the two, she determined upon the utter destruction of the weaker.
Strong as Fate, and unrelenting as Time, she dedicated her life to that end.
Everything, she said, comes to those who can wait. She forgot that the
Providence above us can wait the longest of us all. In the end it is Providence
that wins.
</p>

<p>
Eva came in, and Florence heard her make her way up the stairs to her room.
Again she spoke to herself:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The poor fool will weep over him and renounce him. If she had the
courage she would follow him and comfort him in his trouble, and so tie him to
her for ever. Oh, that I had her chance! But the chances always come to
fools.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then she went upstairs and listened outside Eva&rsquo;s door. She was sobbing
audibly. Turning the handle, she walked casually in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Eva, did you&mdash;Why, my dear girl, <i>what</i> is the matter
with you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva, who was lying sobbing on her bed, turned her head to the wall and went on
sobbing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What <i>is</i> the matter, Eva? If you only knew how absurd you
look!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No-no-thing!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! People do not make such scenes as this for nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, my dear, as your affectionate sister, I really must ask what has
happened to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The tone was commanding, and half unconsciously Eva obeyed it.
&ldquo;Ernest!&rdquo; she ejaculated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what about Ernest? He is nothing to you, is he?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No&mdash;that is, yes. O, it is so dreadful! It was the letter;&rdquo;
and she touched a sheet of closely written paper that lay on the bed beside
her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, as you do not seem to be in a condition to explain yourself,
perhaps you had better let me read the letter.&rdquo; &ldquo;O no.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! Give it me; perhaps I may be able to help you;&rdquo; and she
took the paper from her unresisting grasp, and, turning her face from the
light, read it deliberately through.
</p>

<p>
It was very passionate in its terms, and rather incoherent; such a letter, in
short, as a lad almost wild with love and grief would write under the
circumstances.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So,&rdquo; said Florence, as she coolly folded it up, &ldquo;it appears
that you are engaged to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
No answer, unless sobs can be said to constitute one. &ldquo;And it seems that
you are engaged to a man who has just committed a frightful murder, and run
away from the consequences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva sat up on the bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It was not a murder; it was a duel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely, a duel about another woman; but the law calls it murder. If
he is caught he will be hanged.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Florence! how can you say such dreadful things?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only say what is true. Poor Eva, I do not wonder that you are
distressed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is all so dreadful!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You love him, I suppose?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, dearly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you must get over it; you must never think of him any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never think of him! I shall think of him all my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is as it may be. You must never have anything more to do with him.
He has blood upon his hands, blood shed for some bad woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot desert him, Florence, because he has got into trouble.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Over another woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A peculiar expression of pain passed over Eva&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How cruel you are, Florence! He is only a boy, and boys will go wrong
sometimes. Anybody can make a fool of a boy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it seems that boys can make fools of some people who should know
better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Florence, what is to be done? You have such a clear head; tell me what
I must do. I cannot give him up; I cannot indeed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence seated herself on the bed beside her sister, and put an arm round her
neck and kissed her. Eva was much touched at her kindness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor Eva,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I am so sorry for you! But tell me,
when did you get engaged to him&mdash;that evening you went out sailing
together?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He kissed you, I suppose, and all that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. Oh, I was so happy!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My poor Eva!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you I cannot give him up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, perhaps there will be no need for you to do so. But you must not
answer that letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because it will not do. Look at it which way you will, Ernest has just
killed his own cousin in a quarrel about another woman. It is necessary that
you should mark your disapproval of that in some way or other. Do not answer
his letter. If in time he can wash himself clear of the reproach, and remains
faithful to you, then it will be soon enough to show that you still care for
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if I leave him like that, he will fall into the hands of other
women, though he loves me all the time. I know him well; his is not a nature
that can stand alone.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, let him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Florence, you forget I love him, too. I cannot bear to think of it.
O, I love him, I love him!&rdquo; and she dropped her head upon her
sister&rsquo;s shoulder and began to sob again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear, it is just because you do love him so that you should prove
him; and besides, my dear, you have your own self-respect to think of. Be
guided by me, Eva; do not answer that letter; I am sure that you will regret it
if you do. Let matters stand for a few months, then we can arrange a plan of
action. Above all, do not let your engagement transpire to anybody. There will
be a dreadful scandal about this business, and it will be most unpleasant for
you, and, indeed, for us all, to have our name mixed up in the matter. Hark!
there is aunt coming in. I will go and talk to her; you can stop here and
recover yourself a little. You will follow my advice, will you not,
dearest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; answered Eva, with a heavy sigh, as she buried her
face in the pillow.
</p>

<p>
Then Florence left her.

THE LOCUM TENENS</h2>

<p>
And so it came to pass that Ernest&rsquo;s letter remained unanswered. But Mr.
Cardus, Dorothy, and Jeremy all wrote. Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s letter was very kind
and considerate. It expressed his deep grief at what had happened, and told him
of the excitement that the duel had caused, and of the threatening letters
which he had received from Sir Hugh Kershaw, who was half-wild with grief and
fury at the loss of his son. Finally, it commended his wisdom in putting the
seas between himself and the avengers of blood, and told him that he should not
want for money, as his drafts would be honoured to the extent of a thousand a
year, should he require so much&mdash;Mr. Cardus was very open-handed where
Ernest was concerned; also if he required any particular sum of money for any
purpose, such as to buy land or start a business, he was to let him know.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy&rsquo;s letter was like herself, sweet and gentle, and overflowing with
womanly sympathy. She bade him not to be down-hearted, but to hope for a time
when all this dreadful business would be forgotten, and he would be able to
return in peace to England. She bade him also, shyly enough, to remember that
there was only one Power that could really wash away the stain of blood upon
his hands. Every month she said she would write him a letter, whether he
answered it or not. This promise she faithfully kept.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy&rsquo;s letter was characteristic. It is worth transcribing:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My DEAR OLD Fellow,&mdash;Your news has knocked us all into the middle
of next week. To think of your fighting a duel, and my not being there to hold
the sponge! And I will tell you what it is, old chap: some of these people
round here, like that old De Talor, call it murder, but that is gammon, and
don&rsquo;t you trouble your head about it. It was he who got up the row, not
you, and he tried to shoot you into the bargain. I am awfully glad that you
kept your nerve and plugged him; it would have been better if you could have
nailed him through the right shoulder, which would not have killed him; but at
the best of times you were never good enough with a pistol for that.
Don&rsquo;t you remember when we used to shoot with the old pistols at the man
I cut out on the cliff, you were always just as likely to hit him on the head
or in the stomach as through the heart? It is a sad pity that you did not
practise a little more, but it is no use crying over spilt milk&mdash;and after
all the shot seems to have been a very creditable one. So you are going on a
shooting expedition up in Secocoeni&rsquo;s country. That is what I call
glorious. To think of a rhinoceros makes my mouth water; I would give one of my
fingers to shoot one. Life here is simply wretched now that you have
gone&mdash;Mr. Cardus as glum as Titheburgh Abbey on a cloudy day, and Doll
always looking as though she had been crying, or were going to cry. Old
Grandfather Atterleigh is quite lively compared to those two. As for the
office, I hate it, everlastingly copying deeds which I don&rsquo;t in the
slightest understand, and adding up figures in which I make mistakes. Your
respected uncle told me the other day, in his politest way, that he considered
I sailed as near being a complete fool as any man he ever knew. I answered that
I quite agreed with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I met that young fellow Smithers the other day, the one who gave Eva
Ceswick that little brute of a dog. He said something disagreeable about
wondering if they would hang you. I told him that I didn&rsquo;t know if they
would or not, but unless he dropped his infernal sneer I was very sure that I
would break his neck. He concluded to move on. By the way, I met Eva Ceswick
herself yesterday. She looked pale, and asked if we had heard anything of you.
She said that she had got a letter from you. Florence came up here, and spoke
up well for you; she said that she was proud of you, or would be if she had a
right to. I never liked her before, but now I think that she is a brick.
Good-bye, old chap; I never wrote such a long letter before. You don&rsquo;t
know how I miss you; life don&rsquo;t seem worth having. Yesterday was the
First; I went out and killed twenty brace to my own gun&mdash;fired forty-six
cartridges. Not bad, eh! And yet somehow I didn&rsquo;t seem to care a twopenny
curse about the whole thing, though if you had been there you would have duffed
them awfully. I feel sure you would have set my teeth on edge with letting them
off&mdash;the birds, I mean. Mind you write to me often. Good-bye, old fellow.
God bless you!
</p>

<p class="center">
&ldquo;Your affectionate friend,
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Jeremy Jones.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;P.S.&mdash;In shooting big game, a fellow told me that the top of the
flank raking forward is a very deadly shot, as it either breaks the back or
passes through the kidneys to the lungs or heart. I should have thought that
the shot was very apt to waste itself in the flesh of the flank. Please try it,
and take notes of the results.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
About a fortnight after these letters, addressed Ernest Beyton, Esq., Post
Office, Maritzburg, Natal, had been despatched, Kesterwick and its
neighbourhood was thrown into a state of mild excitement by the announcement
that Mr. Halford, the clergyman, whose health had of late been none of the
best, purposed taking a year&rsquo;s rest, and that the Bishop had consented to
the duties of his parish being carried on by a locum tenens, named the Reverend
James Plowden. Mr. Halford was much liked and respected, and the intelligence
was received with general regret, which was, however, tempered with curiosity
as to the new-comer. Thus, when it became known that Mr. Plowden was to preach
in the parish church at the evening service on the third Sunday in September,
all Kesterwick was seized with profound religious fervour, and went to hear
him.
</p>

<p>
The parish church at Kesterwick was unusually large and beautiful, being a
relic of an age when, whatever men&rsquo;s lives may have been, they spared
neither their money nor their thought in rearing up fitting habitations to the
Deity, whom they regarded perhaps with more of superstitious awe than true
religious feeling. Standing as it did somewhat back from the sea, it alone had
escaped the shock of the devouring waves, and remained till this day a monument
of architectural triumph. Its tall tower, pointing like a great finger up to
heaven, looked very solemn on that quiet September evening as the crowd of
church-goers passed beneath its shadow into the old doorway, through which most
of them had been carried to their christening, and would in due time be carried
to their burial. At least so thought Eva and Dorothy, as they stood for a
moment by the monument to &ldquo;five unknown sailors,&rdquo; washed ashore
after a great gale, and buried in a common grave. How many suffering, erring
human beings had stood upon the same spot and thought the same thoughts! How
many more now sleeping in the womb of time would stand there and think them,
when these two had suffered and erred their full, and been long forgotten!
</p>

<p>
They formed a strange contrast, those two sweet women, as they passed together
into the sacred stillness of the church&mdash;the one stately, dark, and
splendid, with an unrestful trouble in her eyes; the other almost insignificant
in figure, but pure and patient of face, and with steady blue eyes which never
wavered. Did they guess, those two, as they walked thus together, how closely
their destinies were linked? Did they know that each at heart was striving for
the same prize&mdash;a poor one indeed, but still all the world to them?
Perhaps they did, very vaguely, and it was the pressure of their common trouble
that drew them closer together in those days. But if they did, they never spoke
of it; and as for little Dorothy, she never dreamed of winning. She was content
to be allowed to toil along in the painful race.
</p>

<p>
When they reached the pew that the Ceswicks habitually occupied, they found
Miss Ceswick and Florence already there. Jeremy had refused to come; he had a
most unreasonable antipathy to parsons. Mr. Halford he liked, but of this new
man he would have none. The general curiosity to see him was to Jeremy
inexplicable, his opinion being that he should soon see a great deal more of
him than he liked. &ldquo;Just like a pack of girls running after a new
doll,&rdquo; he growled; &ldquo;well, there is one thing, you will soon be
tired of hearing him squeak.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As the service went on, the aisles of the great church grew dim except where
the setting sun shot a crimson shaft through the west window, which wandered
from spot to spot and face to face, and made them glorious. When it came to the
hymn before the sermon, Eva could scarcely see to read, and with the exception
of the crimson pencil of sunlight that came through the head of the Virgin
Mary, and wavered restlessly about, and the strong glow of the lights upon the
pulpit, the church was almost dark.
</p>

<p>
When the new clergyman, Mr. Plowden, ascended the steps of the ancient pulpit
and gave out his text, Eva looked at him in common with the rest of the
congregation. Mr. Plowden was a large man of a somewhat lumbering make. His
head, too, was large, and covered with masses of rather coarse-textured black
hair. The forehead was prominent, and gave signs of intellectual power; the
eyebrows thick and strongly marked, and in curious contrast to the cold
light-gray eyes that played unceasingly beneath them. All the lower part of the
face, which, to judge from the purple hue of the skin, Nature had intended
should be plentifully clothed with hair, was clean shaven, and revealed a large
jaw, square chin, and pair of thick lips. Altogether Mr. Plowden was considered
a fine man, and his face was generally spoken of as &ldquo;striking.&rdquo;
Perhaps the most curious thing about it, however, was a species of varicose
vein on the forehead, which was generally quite unnoticeable, but whenever he
was excited or nervous stood out above the level of the skin in the form of a
perfect cross. It was thus visible when Eva looked at him, and it struck her as
being an unpleasant mark to have on one&rsquo;s forehead. She turned her eyes
away&mdash;the man did not please her fastidious taste&mdash;and listened for
his voice. Presently it came; it was powerful and even musical, but coarse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is not a gentleman,&rdquo; thought Eva to herself; and then
dismissing him and his sermon too from her mind, she leaned back against the
poppy-head at the end of the pew, half-closed her eyes, and let her thoughts
wander in the way that thoughts have the power to do in church. Far across the
sea they flew, to where a great vessel, labouring in a heavy gale, was
ploughing her sturdy way along&mdash;to where a young man stood clinging to the
iron stanchions, and gazed out into the darkness with sorrow in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
Wonderfully soft and tender grew her beautiful face as the vision passed before
her soul; the ripe lips quivered, and there was a world of love in the
half-opened eyes. And just then the wandering patch of glory perceived her,
settled on her like a butterfly upon a flower, and for a while wandered no
longer.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly she became aware of a momentary pause in the even flow of the
clergyman&rsquo;s eloquence, and waking from her reverie, glanced up at that
spot of light surrounding him, and as she did so it struck her that she herself
was illuminated with a more beautiful light&mdash;that he and she alone were
distinguishable out of all the people beneath that roof.
</p>

<p>
The same thought had evidently struck Mr. Plowden, for he was gazing intently
at her.
</p>

<p>
Instinctively she drew back into the shadow, and Mr. Plowden went on with his
sermon. But he had driven away poor Eva&rsquo;s vision; there only remained of
it the sad reproachful look of those dark eyes.
</p>

<p>
Outside the church Dorothy found Jeremy waiting to escort her home. They all
went together as far as the Cottage. When they got clear of the crowd Florence
spoke:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What a good-looking man Mr. Plowden is, and how well he preached!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did not like him much,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you think of him, Eva?&rdquo; asked Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I? Oh, I do not know. I do not think he is a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure that he is not,&rdquo; put in Jeremy. &ldquo;I saw him by the
post-office this afternoon. He is a cad.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rather a sweeping remark that, is it not, Mr. Jones?&rdquo; said
Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know if it is sweeping or not,&rdquo; answered Jeremy,
sententiously, &ldquo;but I am sure that it is true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then they said good-night, and went their separate ways.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap19"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>
EVA TAKES A DISTRICT</h2>

<p>
The Reverend James Plowden was born of rich but honest parents in the
sugar-broking way. He was one of a large family, who were objects of anxious
thought to Mr. and Mrs. Plowden. These worthy people, aware of the
disadvantages under which they laboured in the matter of education, determined
that neither trouble nor money should be spared to make their children
&ldquo;genteel.&rdquo; And so it came to pass that the &ldquo;mansion&rdquo;
near Bloomsbury was overrun with the most expensive nurses, milliners,
governesses, and tutors, all straining every nerve to secure the perfect
gentility of the young Plowdens. The result was highly ornamental, but scarcely
equivalent to the vast expense incurred. The Plowden youth of both sexes may be
said to have been painted, and varnished, and gilded into an admirable
imitation of gentlefolks; but if the lacquer-work would stand the buffetings of
the world&rsquo;s weather was another question, and one which does not concern
us, except in so far as it has to do with a single member of the family.
</p>

<p>
Master James Plowden came about half-way down the family list, but he might
just as well have stood at the head of it, for he ruled his brothers and
sisters&mdash;old and young&mdash;with a heavy rod. He was the strong one of
the family, strong both in mind and body, and he had a hand of iron.
</p>

<p>
For his misdeeds were his brothers thrashed, preferring to take those ills they
knew of from the hands of the thrasher rather than endure the unimagined
horrors brother James would make ready for them should they venture to protest.
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that he came to be considered <i>par excellence</i> the good boy of
the family, and he was certainly the clever one, and bore every sort of
blushing honour thick upon him.
</p>

<p>
It was to an occurrence in his boyhood that Mr. Plowden owed his parents&rsquo;
determination to send him into the Church. His future career had always been a
matter of much speculation to them, for they belonged to that class of people
who love to arrange their infants&rsquo; destinies when the infants themselves
are still in the cradle, and argue their fitness for certain lines of life from
remarks which they make at three years old.
</p>

<p>
Now, James&rsquo;s mamma had a very favourite parrot with a red tail, and out
of this tail it was James&rsquo;s delight to pull the feathers, having
discovered that so doing gave a parrot a lively twinge of pain. The onus of the
feather-pulling, if discovered, was shouldered on to a chosen brother, who was
promptly thrashed.
</p>

<p>
But on one occasion things went wrong with Master James. The parrot was
climbing up the outside of his cage, presenting the remainder of his tail to
the hand of the spoiler in a way that was irresistibly seductive. But, aware of
the fact that his enemy was in the neighbourhood, he kept a careful look-out
from the corner of his eye, and the moment that he saw James&rsquo;s stealthy
hand draw near his tail made a sudden dart at it, and actually succeeded in
making his powerful beak meet through its forefinger. James shrieked with pain
and fury, and shaking the bird on to the floor, stunned it with a book. But he
was not satisfied with this revenge, for, as soon as he saw that it could no
longer bite, he seized it and twisted its neck.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There, you devil!&rdquo; he said, throwing the creature into the cage.
&ldquo;Hullo, something has burst in my forehead!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O James, what have you done!&rdquo; said his little brother Montague,
well knowing that he had a lively personal interest in James&rsquo;s misdoings.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! what have you done? Now remember, Montague, <i>you</i> killed
the parrot.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then Mr. and Mrs. Plowden came in from a drive, and a very lively scene
ensued, into which we need not enter. Suffice it to say that, all evidence to
the contrary notwithstanding, James was acquitted on the ground of general good
character, and Montague, howling and protesting his innocence, was led off to
execution. Justly fearful lest something further should transpire, James was
hurriedly leaving the room, when his mother called him back. &ldquo;Why, what
is that on your forehead?&rdquo; &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; answered
James; &ldquo;something went snap there just now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I never! Just look at the boy, John; he has got a cross upon his
forehead.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden papa examined the phenomenon very carefully, and then, solemnly
removing his spectacles, remarked with much deliberation:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Elizabeth, that settles the point.&rdquo; &ldquo;What point,
John?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What point! Why, the point of the boy&rsquo;s profession. It is, as you
remark, a cross upon his forehead. Good!&mdash;he shall go into the Church.
Now, I must decline to be argued with, Elizabeth. The matter is settled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so in due course James Plowden, Esq., went to Cambridge, and became the
Reverend James Plowden.
</p>

<p>
Shortly after the Reverend James had started in life as a curate&mdash;having
first succeeded in beguiling his parents into settling on himself a portion
just twice as large as that to which he was entitled&mdash;he found it
convenient to cut off his connection with a family he considered vulgar, and a
drag upon his professional success. But somehow, with all his gifts&mdash;and
undoubtedly he was by nature well-endowed, especially as regards his mind, that
was remarkable for a species of hard cleverness and persuasive power&mdash;and
with all the advantages which he derived from being in receipt of an
independent income, the Reverend James had not hitherto proved a conspicuous
success. He had held some important curacies, and of late had acted as the
locum tenens of several gentlemen who, like Mr. Halford, through loss of health
or other reasons, had been called away from their livings for a length of time.
</p>

<p>
But from all these places the Reverend James had departed without regret, nor
had there been any very universal lamentations over his going. The fact of the
matter was that the Reverend James was not a popular man. He had ability in
plenty, and money in plenty, and would expend both without stint if he had an
end to gain. He was more or less of a good companion, too, in the ordinary
sense of the word; that is, he could make himself agreeable in a rough,
exaggerated kind of way to both men and women. Indeed, by the former he was
often spoken of carelessly as a &ldquo;good fellow;&rdquo; but women, or rather
ladies, following their finer instincts, disliked him intensely. He jarred upon
them.
</p>

<p>
Of course, it is impossible to lay down any fixed rule about men, but there are
two tokens by which they may be known. The first is by their friends; the
second by the degree of friendship and affection to which they are admitted by
women. The man to whom members of the other sex attach themselves is in
ninety-nine cases out of a hundred a good fellow, and women&rsquo;s instinct
tells them so, or they would not love him. It may be urged that women often
love blackguards. To this the answer is, that there must be a good deal of good
mixed up with the blackguardism. Show me the man whom two or three women of his
own rank love with all their honest hearts, and I will trust all I have into
his hands and not be a penny the poorer.
</p>

<p>
But women did not love the Reverend James Plowden, although he had for several
years come to the conclusion that it was desirable that they should, or rather
that one of them should. In plain language he had for some years past thought
that he would improve his position by getting married. He was a shrewd man, and
he could not disguise from himself the fact that so far he was not altogether a
success. He had tried his best, but, with all his considerable advantages, he
had failed. There was only one avenue to success which he had not tried, and
that was marriage. Marriage with a woman of high caste, quick intellect, and
beauty, might give him the tone that his social system so sadly needed. He was
a man in a good position, he had money, he had intelligence of a robust if of a
coarse order, he had fairly good looks, and he was only thirty-five; why should
he not marry blood, brains, and beauty, and shine with a reflected splendour?
</p>

<p>
Such were the thoughts which were simmering in the astute brain of the Reverend
James Plowden when he first set eyes upon Eva Ceswick in the old church at
Kesterwick.
</p>

<p>
Within a week or so of his arrival, Mr. Plowden, in his character of spiritual
adviser to the motley Kesterwick flock, paid a ceremonious call on the Miss
Ceswicks. They were all at home.
</p>

<p>
Miss Ceswick and Florence welcomed him graciously; Eva politely, but with an
air that said plainly that he interested her not at all. Yet it was to Eva that
he chiefly directed himself. He took this opportunity to inform them all,
especially Eva, that he felt the responsibilities of his position as locum
tenens to weigh heavily upon him. He appealed to them all, especially Eva, to
help him to bear his load. He was going to institute a new system of district
visiting. Would they all, especially Eva, assist him? If they would, the good
work was already half done. There was so much for young ladies to do. He could
assure them, from his personal experience, that one visit from a young lady,
however useless she might be in a general way, which his instinct assured him
these particular young ladies before him were not, had more influence with a
distressed and godless family than six from well-meaning but unsympathetic
clergymen like himself. Might he rely on their help?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am afraid that I am too old for that sort of thing, Mr.
Plowden,&rdquo; answered Miss Ceswick. &ldquo;You must see what you can do with
my nieces.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure that I shall be delighted to help,&rdquo; said Florence,
&ldquo;if Eva will bear me company. I always feel a shyness about intruding
myself into cottages unsupported.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Your shyness is not surprising, Miss Ceswick. I suffered from it myself
for many years, but at last I have, I am thankful to say, got the better of it.
But I am sure that we shall not appeal to your sister in vain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall be glad to help if you think that I can do any good,&rdquo; put
in Eva, thus directly appealed to; &ldquo;but I must tell you I have no great
faith in myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do the work. Miss Ceswick, and the faith will come; sow the seed and the
tree will spring up, and bear fruit too in due season.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no reply, so he continued: &ldquo;Then I have your permission to put
you down for a district?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; answered Florence. &ldquo;Will you take some
more tea?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden would take no more tea, but went on his way to finish the
day&rsquo;s work he had mapped out for himself&mdash;for he worked hard and
according to a strict rule&mdash;reflecting that Eva Ceswick was the loveliest
woman he had ever seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that we must congratulate you on a conquest, Eva,&rdquo; said
Miss Ceswick, cheerfully, as the front door closed. &ldquo;Mr. Plowden never
took his eyes off you, and really, my dear, I do not wonder at it; you look
charming.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva flushed up angrily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, aunt!&rdquo; she said, and left the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really,&rdquo; said Miss Ceswick, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know what has
come to Eva lately, she is so very strange.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I expect that you have touched her on a sore point. I rather fancy that
she has taken a liking to Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; said Florence, dryly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, indeed!&rdquo; answered the old lady, nodding her head wisely.
</p>

<p>
In due course a district was assigned to the two Miss Ceswicks, and for her
part Eva was glad of the occupation. It brought her a good deal into contact
with Mr. Plowden, which was not altogether pleasant to her, for she cherished a
vague dislike of the clergyman, and did not admire his shifty eyes. But, as she
got to know him better, she could find nothing to justify her dislike. He was
not, it is true, quite a gentleman, but that was his misfortune. His manner to
herself was subdued and almost deferential; he never obtruded himself upon her
society, though somehow he was in it almost daily. Indeed, he even succeeded in
raising her to some enthusiasm about her work, a quality in which poor Eva had
of late been sadly lacking. She thought him a very good clergyman, with his
heart in his duty. But she disliked him all the same.
</p>

<p>
Eva never answered Ernest&rsquo;s letter. Once she began an answer, but
bethought her of Florence&rsquo;s sage advice, and changed her mind. &ldquo;He
will write again,&rdquo; she said to herself. She did not know Ernest; his was
not a nature to humble itself before a woman. Could she have seen her lover
hanging about the steps of the Maritzburg post-office when the English mail was
being delivered, in order to go back to the window when the people had
dispersed, and ask the tired clerk if he was &ldquo;sure&rdquo; that there were
no more letters for Ernest Beyton, and get severely snubbed for his pains,
perhaps her heart would have relented. And yet it was a performance which poor
Ernest went through once a week out there in Natal.
</p>

<p>
One mail-day Mr. Alston went with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ernest, has it come?&rdquo; he asked, as he came down the steps, a
letter from Dorothy in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Alston, and never will. She has thrown me over.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston took his arm, and walked away with him across the market-square.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, my lad,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;the woman who deserts a man in
trouble, or as soon as his back is turned, is worthless. It is a sharp lesson
to learn, but, as most men have cause to know, the world is full of sharp
lessons and worthless women. You know that she got your letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, she told my friend so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I tell you that your Eva, or whatever her name is, is more
worthless than most of them. She has been tried and found wanting. Look,&rdquo;
he went on, pointing to a shapely Kafir girl passing with a pot of native beer
upon her head, &ldquo;you had better take that Intombi to wife than such a
woman as this Eva. She at any rate would stand by you in trouble, and if you
fell would stop to be killed over your dead body. Come, be a man, and have done
with her.&rdquo;

<p>
&ldquo;Ay, by Heaven I will!&rdquo; answered Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s right; and now, look here, the waggons will be at Lydenburg
in a week. Let us take the post-cart tomorrow and go up. Then we can have a
month&rsquo;s wilderbeeste and koodoo shooting until it is safe to go into the
fever country. Once you get among the big game, you won&rsquo;t think any more
about that woman. Women are all very well in their way, but if it comes to
choosing between them and big game shooting, give me the big game.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap20"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>
JEREMY&rsquo;S IDEA OF A SHAKING</h2>

<p>
Two months or so after Ernest&rsquo;s flight there came a letter from him to
Mr. Cardus in answer to the one sent by his uncle. He thanked his uncle warmly
for his kindness, and more especially for not joining in the hue and cry
against him. As regarded money, he hoped to be able to make a living for
himself, but if he wanted any he would draw. The letter, which was short, ended
thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank Doll and Jeremy for their letters. I would answer them, but I am
too down on my luck to write much; writing stirs up so many painful memories,
and makes me think of all the dear folks at home more than is good for me. The
fact is, my dear uncle, what between one thing and another, I never was so
miserable in my life, and as for loneliness I never knew what it meant before.
Sometimes I wish that my cousin had hit me instead of my hitting him, and that
I was dead and buried, clean out of the way. Alston, who was my second in that
unhappy affair, and with whom I am going up-country shooting, has been most
kind to me, and has introduced me to a good many people here. They are very
hospitable&mdash;everybody is hospitable in a colony; but somehow a hundred new
faces cannot make up for one old one, and I should think old Atterleigh a
cheerful companion beside the best of them. What is more, I feel myself an
impostor intruding myself on them under an assumed name. Good-bye, my dear
uncle. It would be difficult for me to explain how grateful I am for your
goodness to me. Love to dear Doll and Jeremy.
</p> <p class="right">
&ldquo;Ever your affectionate nephew, E. K.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
All the party at Dum&rsquo;s Ness were much touched by this letter, more
especially Dorothy, who could not bear to think of Ernest all alone out there
in that strange far-off land. Her tender little heart grew alive with love and
sorrow as she lay awake at night and thought of him travelling over the great
African plains. She got all the books that were to be had about South Africa
and read them, so that she might be the better able to follow his life in her
thoughts. One day when Florence came to see her she read her part of
Ernest&rsquo;s letter, and when she had finished was astonished to see a tear
in her visitor&rsquo;s keen eyes. She liked Florence the better for that tear.
Could she have seen the conflict that was raging in the fierce heart of the
woman before her, she would have started from her as though she had been a
poisonous snake. The letter touched Florence&mdash;touched her to the quick.
The tale of Ernest&rsquo;s loneliness almost overcame her resolution, for she
alone knew why he was so utterly lonely, and what it was that crushed him. Had
Ernest alone been concerned, it is probable that she would then and there have
thrown up her cruel game; but he was not alone concerned. There was her sister
who had robbed her of her lover&mdash;her sister whose loveliness was a
standing affront to her as her sweetness was a standing reproach. She was sorry
for Ernest, and would have been glad to make him happier, but as that could
only be done by foregoing her revenge upon her sister, Ernest must continue to
suffer. And after all why should he not suffer? she argued. Did not she suffer?
</p>

<p>
When Florence got home she told Eva about the letter from her lover, but she
said nothing of his evident distress. He was making friends, he expected great
pleasure from his shooting&mdash;altogether he was getting on well.
</p>

<p>
Eva listened, hardened her heart, and went out district visiting with Mr.
Plowden.
</p>

<p>
Time went on, and no letters came from Ernest. One month, two months, six
months passed, and there was no intelligence of him. Dorothy grew very anxious,
and so did Mr. Cardus, but they did not speak of the matter much, except to
remark that the reason no doubt was that he was away on his shooting excursion.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy also, in his slow way, grew intensely preoccupied with the fact that
they never heard from Ernest now, and that life was consequently a blank. He
sat upon the stool in his uncle&rsquo;s outer office and made pretence to copy
deeds and drafts, but in reality he occupied his time in assiduously polishing
his nails and thinking. As for the deeds and drafts, he gave them to his
grandfather to copy. &ldquo;It kept the old gentleman employed,&rdquo; he would
explain to Dorothy, &ldquo;and from indulging in bad thoughts about the
devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But it was one night out duck-shooting that his great inspiration came. It was
a bitter night, a night on which no sane creature except Jeremy would ever have
dreamed of going to shoot ducks or anything else. The marshes were partially
frozen, and a fierce east wind was blowing across them; but utterly regardless
of the cold, there sat Jeremy under the lee of a dike bank, listening for the
sound of the ducks&rsquo; wings as they passed to their feeding-grounds, and
occasionally getting a shot at them as they crossed the moon above him. There
were not many ducks, and the solitude and silence were inductive to
contemplation. Ernest did not write. Was he dead? Not probable, or they would
have heard of it. Where was he, then? Impossible to say, impossible to
discover. Was it impossible? &ldquo;<i>Swish, swish, bang!</i>&rdquo; and down
came a mallard at his feet. A quick shot, that! Yes, it was impossible; they
had no means of inquiry here. The inquiry, if any, must be made there, on the
other side of the water. But who was to make it? Ah! an idea struck him. Why
should not he, Jeremy, make that inquiry? Why should he not go to South Africa
and look for Ernest? A flight of duck passed over his head unheeded. What did
he care for duck? He had solved the problem which had been troubling him all
these months. He would go to South Africa and look for Ernest. If Mr. Cardus
would not give him the money, he would work his way out. Anyhow he would go. He
could bear the suspense no longer.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy rose in the new-found strength of his purpose, and gathering up the
slain&mdash;there were only three&mdash;whistled to his retriever, and made his
way back to Dum&rsquo;s Ness.
</p>

<p>
He found Mr. Cardus and Dorothy by the fire in the sitting-room. Hard-riding
Atterleigh was there too, in his place in the ingle-nook, a riding-whip in his
ink-stained hand, with which he was tapping his top-boot. They turned as he
entered, except his grandfather, who did not hear him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What sport have you had, Jeremy?&rdquo; asked his sister, with a sad
little smile. Her face had grown very sad of late.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three ducks,&rdquo; he answered shortly, advancing his powerful
form out of the shadows into the firelight. &ldquo;I came home just as they
were beginning to fly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You found it cold, I suppose?&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, absently. They had
been talking of Ernest, and he was still thinking of him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I did not think of the cold. I came home because I had an
idea.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Both his hearers looked up surprised. Ideas were not very common to Jeremy, or
if they were he kept them to himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Jeremy?&rdquo; said Dorothy, inquiringly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it is this. I cannot stand it about Ernest any longer, and I am
going to look for him. If you won&rsquo;t give me the money,&rdquo; he went on,
addressing Mr. Cardus almost fiercely, &ldquo;I will work my way out. It is no
credit to me,&rdquo; he added; &ldquo;I lead a dog&rsquo;s life while I
don&rsquo;t know where he is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy flushed a pale pink with pleasure. Rising, she went up to her great
strong brother, and standing on tip-toe, managed to kiss him on the chin.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is like you, Jeremy dear,&rdquo; she said, softly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus looked up too, and after his fashion let his eyes wander round
Jeremy before he spoke.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You shall have as much money as you like, Jeremy,&rdquo; he said
presently; &ldquo;and if you bring Ernest back safe, I will leave you twenty
thousand pounds;&rdquo; and he struck his hand down upon his knee, an evidence
of excitement which it was unusual for him to display.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t want your twenty thousand pounds&mdash;I want
Ernest,&rdquo; answered the young man, gruffly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I know you don&rsquo;t, my lad; I know you don&rsquo;t. But find him
and keep him safe, and you shall have it. Money is not to be sneezed at, let me
tell you. I say keep him, for I forgot you cannot bring him back till this
accursed business has blown over. When will you go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the next mail, of course. They leave every Friday; I will not waste a
day. To-day is Saturday; I will sail next Friday.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is right: you shall go at once. I will give you a cheque for
&pound;500 to-morrow, and mind, Jeremy, you are not to spare money. If he has
gone to the Zambesi, you must follow him. Never think of the money; I will
think of that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy soon made his preparations. They consisted chiefly of rifles. He was to
leave Dum&rsquo;s Ness early on the Thursday. On the Wednesday afternoon it
occurred to him that he might as well tell Eva Ceswick that he was going in
search of Ernest, and ask if she had any message. Jeremy was the only person,
or thought that he was the only person, in the secret of Ernest&rsquo;s
affection for Eva. Ernest had asked him to keep it secret, and he had kept it
as secret as the dead, never breathing a word of it, even to his sister.
</p>

<p>
It was about five o&rsquo;clock on a windy March afternoon when he set out for
the Cottage. On the edge of the hamlet of Kesterwick, some three hundred yards
from the cliff, stood two or three little hovels, turning their naked faces to
the full fury of the sea-blast. He was drawing near to these when he came to a
stile which gave passage over a sod wall that ran to the edge of the cliff,
marking the limits of the village common. As he approached the stile the wind
brought him the sound of voices&mdash;a man&rsquo;s and a
woman&rsquo;s&mdash;engaged apparently in angry dispute on the farther side of
the wall. Instead of getting over the stile, he stepped to the right and looked
over the wall, and saw the new clergyman, Mr. Plowden, standing with his back
towards him, and, apparently very much against her will, holding Eva Ceswick by
the hand. Jeremy was too far off to overhear his words, but from his voice it
was clear that Plowden was talking in an excited, masterful tone. Just then Eva
turned her head a little, and he did hear what she said, her voice being so
much clearer:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Mr. Plowden, no! Let go my hand. Ah! why will you not take an
answer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just at that moment she succeeded in wrenching her imprisoned hand from his
strong grasp, and without waiting for any more words, set off towards
Kesterwick almost at a run.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy was a man of slow mind, though when once his mind was made up, it was of
a singularly determined nature. At first he did not quite take in the full
significance of the scene, but when he did a great red flush spread over his
honest face, and the big gray eyes sparkled dangerously. Presently Mr. Plowden
turned and saw him. Jeremy noticed that the &ldquo;sign of the cross&rdquo; was
remarkably visible on his forehead, and that his face wore an expression by no
means pleasant to behold&mdash;anything but Christian, in short.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; he said to Jeremy; &ldquo;what are you doing there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Before answering, Jeremy put his hand on the top of the sod wall, and vaulting
over, walked straight up to the clergyman.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was watching you,&rdquo; he said, looking him straight in the eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&mdash;an honourable employment; eavesdropping I think it is
generally called.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Whatever had passed between Mr. Plowden and Eva Ceswick, it had clearly not
improved the former&rsquo;s temper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean what I say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Plowden, I may as well tell you what <i>I</i> mean; I am not
good at talking, but I know that I shall be able to make you understand. I saw
you just now assaulting Miss Ceswick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a lie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is not a gentlemanlike word, Mr. Plowden, but as you are not a
gentleman I will overlook it.&rdquo; Jeremy, after the dangerous fashion of the
Anglo-Saxon race, always got wonderfully cool as a row thickened. &ldquo;I
repeat that I saw you holding her, notwithstanding her struggles to get
away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what is that to you, confound you!&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden, shaking
with fury, and raising a thick stick he held in his hand in a suggestive
manner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t lose your temper, and you shall hear. Miss Eva Ceswick is
engaged to my friend Ernest Kershaw, or something very like it, and, as he is
not here to look after his own interests, I must look after them for
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes,&rdquo; answered Mr. Plowden, with a ghastly smile, &ldquo;I
have heard of that. The murderer, yon mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I recommend you, Mr. Plowden, in your own interest, &ldquo;to be a
little more careful in your terms.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And supposing that there has been something between your&mdash;your
friend&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Much better term, Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And Miss Eva Ceswick, what, I should like to know, is there to prevent
her having changed her mind?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy laughed aloud, it must be admitted rather insolently, and in a way
calculated to irritate people of meeker mind than Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To any one, Mr. Plowden, who has the privilege of your acquaintance, and
who also knows Ernest Kershaw, your question would seem absurd. You see, there
are some people between whom there can be no comparison. It is not possible
that, after caring for Ernest, any woman could care for you;&rdquo; and Jeremy
laughed again.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s thick lips turned quite pale, the veinous cross upon his
forehead throbbed until Jeremy thought that it would burst, and his eyes shone
with the concentrated light of hate. His vanity was his weakest point. He
controlled himself with an effort, however; though if there had been any deadly
weapon at hand it might have gone hard with Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you will explain the meaning of your interference and your
insolence, and let me go on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, with pleasure,&rdquo; answered Jeremy, with refreshing cheerfulness.
&ldquo;It is just this; if I catch you at any such tricks again, you shall
suffer for it. One can&rsquo;t thrash a clergyman, and one can&rsquo;t fight
him, because he won&rsquo;t fight; but look here, one can <i>shake him,</i> for
that leaves no marks; and if you go on with these games, so sure as my name is
Jeremy Jones, I will shake your teeth down your throat! Good-night!&rdquo; and
Jeremy turned to go.
</p>

<p>
It is not wise to turn one&rsquo;s back upon an infuriated animal, and at that
moment Mr. Plowden was nothing more. Even as he turned, Jeremy remembered this,
and gave himself a slew to one side. It was fortunate for him that he did so,
for at that moment Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s heavy blackthorn stick, directed
downwards with ail the strength of Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s powerful arm, passed
within a few inches of his head, out of which, had he not turned, it would have
probably knocked the brains. As it was, it struck the ground with such force
that the jar sent it flying out of its owner&rsquo;s hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you would!&rdquo; was Jeremy&rsquo;s reflection as he sprang at his
assailant.
</p>

<p>
Now Mr. Plowden was a very powerful man, but he was no match for Jeremy, who in
after days came to be known as the strongest man in the east of England, and so
he was destined to find out. Once Jeremy got a grip of him&mdash;for his
respect for the Church prevented him from trying to knock him down&mdash;he
seemed to crumple up like a piece of paper in his iron grasp. Jeremy could
easily have thrown him, but he would not; he had his own ends in view. So he
just held the Reverend James tight enough to prevent him from doing him any
serious injury, and let him struggle frantically till he thought he was
sufficiently exhausted for his purpose. Then Jeremy suddenly gave him a violent
twist, got behind him, and set to work with a will to fulfil his promise of a
shaking. O, what a shake that was! First of all he shook him backwards and
forwards for Ernest&rsquo;s sake, then he alternated the motion and shook him
from side to side for his own sake, and finally he shook him every possible way
for the sake of Eva Ceswick.
</p>

<p>
It was a wonderful sight to see the great burly clergyman, his hat off, his
white tie undone, and his coat-tails waving like streamers, bounding and
gambolling on the breezy cliffs, his head, legs, and arms jerking in every
possible direction, like those of a galvanised frog; while behind him, his legs
slightly apart to get a better grip of the ground, and his teeth firmly
clinched, Jeremy shook away with the fixity of Fate.
</p>

<p>
At last, getting exhausted, he stopped, and, holding Mr. Plowden still, gave
him a drop-kick&mdash;only one. But Jeremy&rsquo;s leg was very strong, and he
always wore thick boots, and the result was startling. Mr. Plowden rose some
inches off the ground, and went on his face into a furze-bush.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus07"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig07.jpg" width="401" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;The result was startling.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;He will hardly like to show <i>that</i> honourable wound,&rdquo;
reflected Jeremy, as he wiped the perspiration from his brow with every sign of
satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
Then he went and picked his fallen enemy out of the bush, where he had nearly
fainted, smoothed his clothes, tied the white tie as neatly as he could, and
put the wide hat on the dishevelled hair. Then he sat him down on the furze to
recover himself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-night, Mr. Plowden, good-night. Next time you wish to hit a man
with a big stick, do not wait till his back is turned. Ah, I daresay your head
aches. I should advise you to go home and have a nice sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Jeremy departed on his way, filled with a fearful joy.
</p>

<p>
When he reached the Cottage he found everything in a state of confusion. Miss
Ceswick, it appeared, had been suddenly taken very seriously ill; indeed, it
was feared that she had got a stroke of apoplexy. He managed, however, to send
up a message to Eva to say that he wished to speak to her for a minute.
Presently she came down, crying.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, my poor aunt is so dreadfully ill,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;We think
that she is dying!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy offered some awkward condolences, and indeed was much distressed. He
liked old Miss Ceswick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going to South Africa to-morrow. Miss Eva,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
She started violently, and blushed up to her hair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Going to South Africa! What for?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going to look for Ernest. We are afraid that something must have
happened to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, don&rsquo;t say that!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Perhaps he
has&mdash;amusements which prevent his writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I may as well tell you that I saw something of what passed between you
and Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Eva blushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Plowden was very rude,&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So I thought; but I think that he is sorry for it now!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that I nearly shook his ugly head off for him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, how could you?&rdquo; Eva asked, severely; but there was no severity
on her face.
</p>

<p>
Just then Florence&rsquo;s voice was heard calling imperatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must go,&rdquo; said Eva.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you any message for Ernest, if I find him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva hesitated.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know all about it,&rdquo; said Jeremy, considerately turning his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, I have no message&mdash;that is&mdash;O, tell him <i>that I love
him dearly!</i>&rdquo; and she turned and fled upstairs.

<h2><a name="chap21"></a>CHAPTER V.<br/>
FLORENCE ON MARRIAGE</h2>

<p>
Miss Ceswick&rsquo;s seizure turned out to be even worse than was anticipated.
Once she appeared to regain consciousness, and began to mutter something; then
she sank back into a torpor, out of which she never woke again.
</p>

<p>
It was fortunate that her condition was not such as to require the services of
the clergyman, because, for some time after the events described in the last
chapter, Mr. Plowden was not in any condition to give them. Whether it was the
shaking or the well-planted kick or the shock to his system it is impossible to
say, but in the upshot he was constrained to keep his bed for several days.
Indeed, the first service that he took was on the occasion of the opening of
the ancient Ceswick vault to receive the remains of the recently deceased lady.
The only territorial possession which remained to the Ceswicks was their vault.
Indeed, as Florence afterwards remarked to her sister, there was a certain
irony in the reflection that of all their wide acres there remained only the
few square feet of soil which for centuries had covered the bones of the race.
</p>

<p>
When their aunt was dead and buried the two girls went back to the Cottage, and
were very desolate. They had both of them loved the old lady in their separate
ways, more especially Florence, both because she possessed the deeper nature of
the two and because she had lived the longest with her.
</p>

<p>
But the grief of youth at the departure of age is not inconsolable, and after a
month or so they had conquered the worst of their sorrow. Then it was that the
question what they were to do came prominently to the fore. Such little
property as their aunt had possessed was equally divided between them, and the
Cottage left to their joint use. This gave them enough to live on in their
quiet way, but it undoubtedly left them in a very lonely and unprotected
position. Such as it was, however, they, or rather Florence&mdash;for she
managed all the business&mdash;decided to make the best of it. At Kesterwick,
at any rate, they were known, and it was, they felt, better to stay there than
to float away and become waifs and strays on the great sea of English life. So
they settled to stay.
</p>

<p>
Florence had, moreover, her own reasons for staying. She had come to the
conclusion that it would be desirable that her sister Eva should marry Mr.
Plowden. Not that she liked Mr. Plowden&mdash;her lady&rsquo;s instincts rose
up in rebellion against the man&mdash;but if Eva did not marry him, it was
probable that she would in the long-run marry Ernest, and Ernest, Florence
swore, she should not marry. To prevent such a marriage was the main purpose of
her life. Her jealousy and hatred of her sister had become a part of herself;
the gratification of her revenge was the evil star by which she shaped her
course. It may seem a terrible thing that so young a woman could give the best
energies of her life to such a purpose, but it was none the less the truth.
</p>

<p>
Hers was a wild strange nature, a nature capable of violent love and violent
hate; the same pendulum could swing with equal ease to each extreme. Eva had
robbed her of Her lover; she would rob Eva, and put the prize out of her reach
too. Little she recked of the wickedness of her design; for where in the long
record of human crime is there a wickedness to surpass the deliberate
separation, for no good reason, of two people who love each other with all
their hearts? Surely there is none. She knew this, but she did not hesitate on
that account. She was not hypocritical. She made no excuses to herself. She
knew well that on every ground it was best that Eva should marry Ernest, and
pursue her natural destiny, happy in his love and in her own. But she would
have none of it. If once they should meet again, the game would pass out of her
hands; for the weakest woman grows strong of purpose when she has her
lover&rsquo;s arm to lean on. Florence realised this, and determined that they
should never set eyes on each other until an impassable barrier, in the shape
of Mr. Plowden, had been raised between the two. Having thus finally determined
on the sacrifice, she set about whetting the knife.
</p>

<p>
One day, a month or so after Miss Ceswick was buried, Mr. Plowden called at the
Cottage on some of the endless details of which district-visiting was the
parent. He had hardly seen Eva since that never-to-be-forgotten day, when he
had learned what Jeremy&rsquo;s ideas of a shaking were, for the very good
reason that she had carefully kept out of his way.
</p>

<p>
So it came to pass that when, looking out of the window on the afternoon in
question, she saw the crown of a clerical hat coming along the road, Eva
promptly gathered up her work and commenced a hasty retreat to her bedroom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to, Eva?&rdquo; asked her sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Upstairs&mdash;here he comes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;He&rsquo;! who is &lsquo;he&rsquo;?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Plowden, of course.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why should you run away because Mr. Plowden is coming?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not like Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Eva, you are too bad. You know what a friendless position we are
in just now, and you go and get up a dislike to one of the few men we know. It
is very selfish of you, and most unreasonable.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the front-door bell rang, and Eva fled.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden on entering looked round the room with a somewhat disappointed air.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you are looking for my sister,&rdquo; said Florence, &ldquo;she is
not very well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed, I am afraid that her health is not good; she is so often
indisposed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled, and they dropped into the district-visiting. Presently,
however, Florence dropped out again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, Mr. Plowden, I want to tell you of something I heard the
other day, and which concerns you. Indeed, I think that it is only right that I
should do so. I heard that you were seen talking to my sister, not very far
from the Titheburgh Abbey cottages, and that she&mdash;she ran away from you.
Then Mr. Jones jumped over the wall, and also began to talk with you. Presently
he also turned, and, so said my informant, you struck at him with a heavy
stick, but missed him. Thereupon a tussle ensued, and you got the worst of
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He irritated me beyond all endurance,&rdquo; broke in Mr. Plowden,
excitedly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, then the story is true?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden saw that he had made a fatal mistake; but it was too late to deny
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To a certain extent,&rdquo; he said, sulkily. &ldquo;That young ruffian
told me that I was not a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really! Of course that was unpleasant. But how glad you must feel that
you missed him, especially as his back was turned! It would have looked so bad
for a clergyman to be had up for assault, or worse, wouldn&rsquo;t it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden turned pale, and bit his lip. He began to feel that he was in the
power of this quiet, dignified young woman, and the feeling was not pleasant.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And it would not look very well if the story got round here, would it? I
mean even if it was not known that you hit at him with the stick when he was
not looking, because, you see, it would seem so absurd! The idea of a clergyman
more than six feet high being shaken like a naughty child! I suppose that Mr.
Jones is very strong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden winced beneath her mockery, and rising, seized his hat; but she
motioned him back to his chair.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t go yet,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I wanted to tell you
that you ought to be much obliged to me for thinking of all this for you. I
thought that it would be painful to you to have the story all over the
country-side, so I nipped it in the bud.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden groaned in spirit. If these were the results of a story nipped in
the bud, what would its uninjured bloom be like?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who told you? &ldquo;he asked, brusquely. &ldquo;Jones went away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. How glad you must be, by the way, that he is gone! But it was not
Mr. Jones, it was a person who oversaw the difference of opinion. No, never
mind who it was; I have found means to silence that person.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little did Mr. Plowden guess that during the whole course of his love-scene,
and the subsequent affair with Jeremy, there had leaned gracefully in an angle
of the sod wall, not twenty yards away, a figure uncommonly resembling that of
an ancient mariner in an attitude of the most intense and solemn contemplation;
but so it was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am grateful to you, Miss Ceswick.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Plowden, it is refreshing to meet with true gratitude, it
is a scarce flower in this world; but really I don&rsquo;t deserve any. The
observer who oversaw the painful scene between you and Mr. Jones also oversaw a
scene preceding it, that, so far as I can gather, seems to have been hardly
less painful in its way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden coloured, but said nothing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now you see, Mr. Plowden, I am left in a rather peculiar position as
regards my sister; she is younger than I am, and has always been accustomed to
look up to me, so, as you will easily understand, I feel my responsibilities to
weigh upon me. Consequently, I feel bound to ask you what I am to understand
from the report of my informant?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Simply this, Miss Ceswick: I proposed to your sister, and she refused
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! you were unfortunate that afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Miss Ceswick,&rdquo; went on Mr. Plowden, after a pause, &ldquo;if I
could find means to induce your sister to change her verdict, would my suit
have your support?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence raised her piercing eyes from her work, and for a second fixed them on
the clergyman&rsquo;s face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That depends, Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am well off,&rdquo; he went on, eagerly, &ldquo;and I will tell you a
secret. I have bought the advowson of this living; I happened to hear that it
was going, and got it at a bargain. I don&rsquo;t think that Halford&rsquo;s
life is worth five years&rsquo; purchase.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you want to marry Eva, Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; asked Florence,
ignoring this piece of information; &ldquo;you are not in love with her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In love! No, Miss Ceswick. I don&rsquo;t think that sensible men fall in
love; they leave that to boys and women.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O! Then why do you want to marry Eva? It will be best to tell me
frankly, Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated, and then came to the conclusion that, with a person of
Florence&rsquo;s penetration, frankness was the best game.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, as you must know, your sister is an extraordinarily beautiful
woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And would therefore form a desirable addition to your
establishment?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely,&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden. &ldquo;Also,&rdquo; he went on,
&ldquo;she is a distinguished-looking woman, and quite the lady.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence shuddered at this phrase.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And would therefore give you social status, Mr. Plowden?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. She is also sprung from an ancient family.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled, and looked at Mr. Plowden with an air that said more plainly
than any words, &ldquo;Which you clearly are not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;In short, I am anxious to get married, and I admire your sister Eva more
than anybody I ever saw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All of which are very satisfactory reasons, Mr. Plowden; all you have to
do is to convince my sister of the many advantages you have to offer her,
and&mdash;to win her affections.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Miss Ceswick, that is just the point. She told me that her
affections were already irredeemably engaged, and that she had none to give. If
only I have the opportunity, however, I shall hope to be able to distance my
rival.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence looked at him scrutinisingly as she answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do not know Ernest Kershaw, or you would not be so confident.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why am I not as good as this Ernest?&rdquo; he asked; for
Florence&rsquo;s remark, identical as it was with that of Jeremy, wounded his
vanity intensely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. Plowden, I do not want to be rude, but it is impossible for me
to conceive a woman&rsquo;s affections being won away from Ernest Kershaw by
you. You are so very <i>different.</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
If Mr. Plowden wanted a straightforward answer, he had certainly got it. For
some moments he sat in sulky silence, and then he said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose, if that is the case, there is nothing to be done.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never said that. Women are frequently married whose affections are
very much engaged elsewhere. You know how they win their wives in savage
countries, Mr. Plowden: they catch them. Marriage by capture is one of the
oldest institutions in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, the same institution still obtains in England, only we don&rsquo;t
call it by that name. Do you suppose that no women are hunted down nowadays?
Ah, very many are; the would-be husband heads the pack, and all the loving
relatives swell its cry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean that your sister can be hunted down,&rdquo; he said, bluntly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I! I mean nothing, except that the persistent suitor on the spot often
has a better chance than the lover at a distance, however dear he may
be.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then Mr. Plowden took his leave. Florence watched him walking down the
garden-path.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am glad Jeremy shook you soundly,&rdquo; she said, aloud. &ldquo;Poor
Eva!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap22"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
MR. PLOWDEN GOES A-WOOING</h2>

<p>
Mr. Plowden was not a suitor to let the grass grow under his feet. As he once
took the trouble to explain to Florence, he considered that there was nothing
like boldness in wooing, and he acted up to his convictions. Possessing no more
delicacy of feeling than a bull-elephant, and as much consideration for the
lady as the elephant has for the lily it tramples underfoot, he, figuratively
speaking, charged at Eva every time he saw her. He laid wait for her round
corners, and asked her to marry him; he dropped in on her at odd hours, and
insisted upon her marrying him. It was quite useless for her to say, &ldquo;No,
no, no,&rdquo; or to appeal to his better feelings or compassion, for he had
none. He simply would not listen to her; but encouraged thereto by the moral
support which he received from Florence, he crushed the poor girl with his
amorous eloquence.
</p>

<p>
It was a merry chase that Florence sat and watched with a dark smile on her
scornful lip. In vain did the poor white doe dash along at her best speed; the
great black hound was ever at her flank, and each time she turned came bounding
at her throat. This idea of a chase, and a hound, and a doe took such a strong
possession of Florence&rsquo;s saturnine imagination, that she actually made a
drawing of it, for she was a clever artist, and not without training, throwing,
by a few strokes of her pencil, a perfect likeness of Mr. Plowden into the
fierce features of the hound. The doe she drew with Eva&rsquo;s dark eyes, and
when she had done them there was such agony in their tortured gaze that she
could not bear to look at them, and tore her picture up.
</p>

<p>
One day Florence came in, and found her sister weeping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Eva, what is it now?&rdquo; she asked, contemptuously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; sobbed Eva.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Mr. Plowden again! Well, my dear, if you will be so beautiful, and
encourage men, you must take the consequences.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I never encouraged Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Eva! you will not get me to believe that. If you did not
encourage him, he would not go on making love to you. Gentlemen are not so fond
of being snubbed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Plowden is not a gentleman,&rdquo; exclaimed Eva.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What makes you say that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because a gentleman would not persecute one as he does. He will not take
No for an answer, and to-day he kissed my hand. I tried to get it away from
him, but I could not. Oh, I hate him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Eva; I have no patience with you and your
fancies. Mr. Plowden is a very respectable man; he is a clergyman, and well
off, altogether quite the sort of man to marry. Ah, Ernest&mdash;I am sick of
Ernest! If he wanted to marry you, he should not go shooting people, and then
running off to South Africa. Don&rsquo;t you be so silly as to pin your faith
to a boy like that. He was all very well to flirt with while he was here; now
he has made a fool of himself and gone, and there is an end of him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But, Florence, I love Ernest. I think I love him more dearly every day,
and I detest Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very likely. I don&rsquo;t ask you to love Mr. Plowden; I ask you to
marry him. What have love and marriage got to do with each other, I should like
to know? If people were always to marry the people they loved, things would
soon get into a pretty mess. Look here, Eva, as you know I do not often obtrude
myself or my own interests, but I think that I have a right to be considered a
little in this matter. You have now got an opportunity of making a home for
both of us. There is nothing against Mr. Plowden. Why should you not marry him
as well as anybody else? Of course, if you choose to sacrifice your own
ultimate happiness and the comfort of us both to a silly whim, I cannot prevent
you; you are your own mistress. Only I beg you to disabuse your mind of the
idea that you could not be happy with Mr. Plowden, because you happen to fancy
yourself in love with Ernest. Why, in six months you will have forgotten all
about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t want to forget about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I daresay not. That is your abominable egotism again. But whether you
want to or not, you will. In a year or two, when you have your own interests
and your children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Florence, you may talk till midnight if you like; but, once and for all,
I will not marry Mr. Plowden;&rdquo; and she swept out of the room in her
stately way.
</p>

<p>
Florence laughed softly to herself as she said after her:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, you will, Eva. I shall be pinning a bride&rsquo;s veil on to
that proud head of yours before you are six months older, my dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence was quite right; it was only a question of time and cunningly applied
pressure. Eva yielded at last.
</p>

<p>
But there is no need for us to follow the hateful story through its various
stages. If by chance any of the readers of this history are curious about them,
let them go and study from the life. Such cases exist around them, and, so far
as the victims are concerned, there is a painful monotony in the development of
their details and their conclusion.
</p>

<p>
And so it came to pass that one afternoon in the early summer, Florence, coming
in from walking, found Mr. Plowden and her sister together in the little
drawing-room. The latter was very pale, and shrinking with scared eyes and
trembling limbs up against the mantelpiece, near which she was standing. The
former, looking big and vulgar, was standing over her and trying to take her
hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Congratulate me, Miss Florence,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Eva has promised
to be mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Has she?&rdquo; said Florence, coldly. &ldquo;How glad you must be that
Mr. Jones is out of the way!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was not a kind speech, but the fact was there were few people in the world
for whom Florence had such a complete contempt, or whom she regarded with such
intense dislike, as she did Mr. Plowden. The mere presence of the man irritated
her beyond all bearing. He was an instrument suited to her purposes, so she
used him; but she could find it in her heart to regret that the instrument was
not more pleasant to handle.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden turned pale at her taunt, and even in the midst of her fear and
misery Eva smiled, and thought to herself that it was lucky for her hateful
lover that somebody else was &ldquo;out of the way.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Poor Eva!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Eva!&rdquo; you think to yourself, my reader. &ldquo;There was
nothing poor about her. She was weak; she was wicked and contemptible.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
O, pause awhile before you say so! Remember that circumstances were against
her; remember that the ideas of duty and of gain drilled into her breast and
the breasts of her ancestresses from generation to generation, and fated as
often as not to prove more of a bane than a blessing, were against her;
remember that her sister&rsquo;s ever-present influence overshadowed her, and
that her suitor&rsquo;s vulgar vitality crushed her to the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yet with it all she was weak,&rdquo; you say. Well, she <i>was</i> weak,
as weak as you must expect women to be after centuries of custom have bred
weakness into their very nature. Why are women weak? Because men have made them
so. Because the law that was framed by men, and the public opinion which it has
been their privilege to direct, have from age to age drilled into women the
belief&mdash;in which, it must be admitted, they for the most part readily
acquiesce&mdash;that they are chattels, to be owned and played with, existing
for the male pleasure and passion. Because men have systematically stunted
their mental growth and denied them their natural rights, and that equality
which is theirs. Weak!&mdash;women have become weak because weakness is the
passport to the favour of our sex. They have become foolish because education
has been withheld from them and ability discouraged; they have become frivolous
because frivolity has been declared to be the natural mission of woman. There
is no male simpleton who does not like to find a bigger simpleton than he is to
lord it over. Truly, the triumph of the stronger sex has been complete, for it
has even succeeded in enlisting its victims in its service. The great
instruments in the suppression of women, and in their retention at their
present level, are women themselves. And yet let us be for a minute just. Which
is the superior of the two&mdash;the woman or the man? In strength we have the
advantage, but in intellect she is almost our equal, if only we will give her
fair-play. And in purity, in tenderness, in long-suffering, in fidelity, in all
the Christian virtues, which is the superior in these things? O man, whoever
you are, think of your mother and your sisters; think of her who nursed you in
sickness, of her who stood by you in trouble when all others would have none of
you, and then answer. Poor Eva! Yes, give her all your pity, but, if you can,
purge it of your contempt. It requires that a woman should possess a mind of
unusual robustness to stand out against circumstances such as hemmed her in,
and this she did not possess. Nature, which had showered physical gifts upon
her with such a lavish hand, had not given her that most useful of all gifts,
the power of self-defence. She was made to yield; but this was her only fault,
an absolutely fatal one. For the rest she was pure as the mountain snow, and
with a heart of gold. Herself incapable of deceit, it never occurred to her to
imagine it in others. She never suspected that Florence could have a motive in
her advocacy of Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s cause. On the contrary, she was possessed
to the full with that idea of duty and self-sacrifice which in some women
amounts almost to madness. The notion so cleverly started by Florence, that she
was bound to take this opportunity of giving her sister a home and the
permanent protection of a brother-in-law, had taken a firm hold of her mind. As
for the cruel wrong and injustice which her marriage with Mr. Plowden would
work to Ernest, strange as it may seem, as is usual in such cases it never
occurred to her to consider the matter in that light. She knew what her own
sufferings were and always must be; she thought that she would rather die than
be false to Ernest; but somehow she never looked at the other side of the
picture, never considered the matter from Ernest&rsquo;s point of view. After
the true womanly fashion she was prepared to throw herself under her Juggernaut
called Duty, and let her inner life, the life of her heart, be crushed out of
her; but she never thought of the other life which was welded with her own, and
which must be crushed too. How curious it is that when women talk so much of
their duties they often think so little of the higher duty which they owe to
the unlucky man whose love they have won, and whom they cherish in their
misguided hearts! The only feasible explanation of the mystery&mdash;outside of
that of innate selfishness&mdash;is, that one of the ideas which has been
persistently drilled into the female breast is that men have not any real
feelings. It is vaguely supposed that they will &ldquo;get over it.&rdquo;
However this may be, when a woman decides to do violence to her natural
feelings, and because of pressure or profit contracts herself into an unholy
marriage, the lover whom she deserts is generally the last person to be
considered. Poor wretch! he will, no doubt, &ldquo;get over it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Fortunately, many do.

OVER THE WATER</h2>

<p>
Mr. Alston and Ernest carried out their plans as regarded sport. They went up
to Lydenburg and had a month&rsquo;s wilderbeeste and blesbok shooting within
three days&rsquo; &ldquo;trek&rdquo; with an ox-waggon from that curious little
town. The style of life was quite new to Ernest, and he enjoyed it much. They
owned an ox-waggon and a span of sixteen &ldquo;salted&rdquo; oxen, that is,
oxen which will not die of lung-sickness, and in this lumbering vehicle they
travelled about wherever fancy or the presence of buck took them. Mr. Alston
and his boy Roger slept in the waggon, and Ernest in a little tent which was
pitched every night alongside, and never did he sleep sounder. There was a
freshness and freedom about the life which charmed him. It is pleasant after
the day&rsquo;s shooting or travelling to partake of a hearty meal, of which
the <i>pièce de résistance</i> generally consists of a stew compounded
indiscriminately of wilderbeeste beef, bustard, partridges, snipe, rice, and
compressed vegetables&mdash;a dish, by the way, which is, if properly cooked,
fit to set before a king. And then comes the pipe, or rather a succession of
pipes, and the talk over the day&rsquo;s sport, and the effect of that long
shot, and the hunting-yarn that it &ldquo;reminds me&rdquo; of. And after the
yarn the well-known square bottle is produced, and the tin pannikins, out of
which you have been drinking tea, are sent to the spring down in the hollow to
be washed by the Zulu &ldquo;voorlooper,&rdquo; who objects to going because of
the &ldquo;spooks&rdquo; (ghosts) which he is credibly informed inhabit that
hollow; and you indulge in your evening &ldquo;tot,&rdquo; and smoke more
pipes, and talk or ruminate as the fancy takes you. And then at last up comes
the splendid African moon like a radiant queen rising from a throne of inky
cloud, flooding the whole wide veldt with mysterious light, and reveals the
long lines of game slowly travelling to their feeding-grounds along the ridges
of the rolling plain.
</p>

<p>
Well, &ldquo;one more drop,&rdquo; and then to bed, having come to the
admirable decision&mdash;so easy to make overnight, so hard to adhere to when
the time comes&mdash;to &ldquo;trek from the yoke&rdquo; at dawn. And then,
having undressed yourself outside the tent, all except the flannel shirt in
which you are going to sleep&mdash;for there is no room to do so
inside&mdash;you stow your clothes and boots away under your mackintosh
sheet&mdash;for clothes wet through with dew are unpleasant to wear before the
sun is up&mdash;creep on your hands and knees into your little tenement, and
wriggle between the blankets.
</p>

<p>
For awhile, perhaps, you lie so, your pipe still between your lips, and gazing
up through the opening of the little tent at two bright particular stars
shining in the blue depths above, or watching the waving of the tall
tambouki-grass as the night-wind goes sighing through it. And then, behold! the
cold far stars draw near, grow warm with life, and change to Eva&rsquo;s
eyes&mdash;if unluckily you have an Eva&mdash;and the yellow tambouki-grass is
her waving hair, and the sad whispering of the wind her voice, which speaks and
tells you that she has come from far across the great seas to tell you that she
loves you to lull you to your rest.
</p>

<p>
What was it that frighted her so soon? The rattling of chains and the deep
lowing of the oxen, rising to be ready for the dawn. It has not come yet; but
it is not far off. See, the gray light begins to gleam upon the oxen&rsquo;s
horns, and far away, there in the east, the gray is streaked with primrose.
Away with dreams, and up to pull the shivering Kafirs from their snug lair
beneath the waggon, and to give the good nags, which must gallop wilderbeeste
all to-day, a double handful of mealies before you start.
</p>

<p>
<i>Ah neu-yak-trek!</i> the great waggon strains and starts, and presently the
glorious sun comes up, and you eat a crust of bread as you sit on the
waggon-box, and wash it down with a mouthful of spirit, and feel that it is a
splendid thing to get up early.
</p>

<p>
Then, about half past eight, comes the halt for breakfast, and the welcome tub
in the clear stream that you have been making for, and, after breakfast, saddle
up the nags, take your bearings by the kopje, and off after that great herd of
wilderbeeste.
</p>

<p>
And so, my reader, day adds itself to day, and each day will find you
healthier, happier, and stronger than the last. No letters, no newspapers, no
duns, no women, and no babies. Think of the joy of it, effete Caucasian, then
go buy an ox-waggon and do likewise.
</p>

<p>
After a month of this life, Mr. Alston came to the conclusion that there would
now be no danger in descending into the low country towards Delagoa Bay in
search of large game. Accordingly, having added to their party another would-be
Nimrod, a gentleman just arrived from England in search of sport, they started.
For the first month or so, things went very well with them. They killed a good
quantity of buffalo, koodoo, eland, and water-buck, also two giraffes; but to
Ernest&rsquo;s great disappointment did not come across any rhinoceros, and
only got a shot at one lion, which he missed, though there were plenty round
them. But soon the luck turned. First their horses died of the terrible scourge
of ail this part of South Africa, the horse-sickness. They had given large
prices for them, about seventy pounds each, as &ldquo;salted&rdquo;
animals&mdash;that is, animals that, having already had the sickness and
recovered from it, were supposed to be proof against its attacks. But for all
that they died one after another. This was only the beginning of evils. The day
after the last horse died, the companion who had joined them at Lydenburg was
taken ill of the fever. Mr. Jeffries&mdash;for that was his name&mdash;was a
very reserved English gentleman of good fortune, something over thirty years of
age. Like most people who came into close relationship with Ernest, he had
taken a considerable fancy to him, and the two were, comparatively speaking,
intimate. During the first stages of his fever, Ernest nursed him like a
brother, and was at length rewarded by seeing him in a fair way to recovery. On
one unlucky day, however, Jeffries being so much better, Mr. Alston and Ernest
went out to try and shoot a buck, as they were short of meat, leaving the camp
in charge of the boy Roger. For a long while they could find no game, but at
last Ernest came across a fine bull-eland standing rubbing himself against a
mimosa thorn-tree. A shot from his express, planted well behind the shoulder,
brought the noble beast down quite dead, and having laden the two Kafirs with
them with the tongue, liver, and as much of the best meat as they could carry,
they started back for camp.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile one of the sudden and tremendous thunderstorms peculiar to South
Africa came swiftly up against the wind, heralding its arrival by a blast of
ice-cold air, and presently they were staggering along in the teeth of a
fearful tempest. The whole sky was lurid with lightning, the hills echoed with
the continuous roll of thunder, and the rain came down in sheets. In the thick
of it all, exhausted, bewildered, and wet to the skin, they reached the camp.
There a sad sight awaited them. In front of the tent which served as a hospital
for Jeffries was a large ant-heap, and on this ant-heap, clad in nothing but a
flannel shirt, sat Jeffries himself. The rain was beating on his bare head and
emaciated face, and the ice-cold breeze was tossing his dripping hair. One hand
he kept raising to the sky to let the cold water fall upon it; the other the
boy Roger held, and by it vainly attempted to drag him back to the tent. But
Jeffries was a man of large build, and the little lad might as well have tried
to drag an ox.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it glorious?&rdquo; shouted the delirious man, as they came
up. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got cool at last!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, and you will soon be cold, poor fellow!&rdquo; muttered Mr. Alston,
as they hurried up.
</p>

<p>
They got him back into the tent, and in half an hour he was beyond all hope. He
did not rave much, but kept repeating a single word in every possible tone,
that word was:
</p>

<p>
<i>Alice.</i>
</p>

<p>
At dawn on the following morning he died with it on his lips. Ernest often
wondered afterwards who &ldquo;Alice&rdquo; could be.
</p>

<p>
Next day they dug a deep grave under an ancient thorn-tree, and reverently laid
him to his rest. On his breast they piled great stones to keep away the
jackals, filling in the cracks with earth.
</p>

<p>
Then they left him to his sleep. It is a sad task this, burying a comrade in
the lonely wilderness.
</p>

<p>
As they were approaching the waggon again, little Roger sobbing
bitterly&mdash;for Mr. Jeffries had been very kind to him, and a first
experience of death is dreadful to the young&mdash;they met the Zulu
voorlooper, a lad called Jim, who had been out all day watching the cattle as
they grazed. He saluted Mr. Alston after the Zulu fashion, by lifting the right
arm and saying the word &ldquo;Inkoos,&rdquo; and then stood still.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what is it, boy? &ldquo;asked Mr. Alston. &ldquo;Have you lost the
oxen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Inkoos, the oxen are safe at the yoke. It is this. When I was
sitting on the kopje yonder, watching that the oxen of the Inkoos should not
stray, an Intombi (young girl) from the kraal under the mountain yonder came to
me. She is the daughter of a Zulu mother who fell into the hands of a Basutu
dog, and my half-cousin.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inkoos, I have met this girl before, I have met her when I have been
sent to buy &lsquo;maas&rsquo; (buttermilk) at the kraal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inkoos, the girl came to bring heavy news, such as will press upon your
heart. Secocoeni, chief of the Bapedi, who lives over yonder under the Blue
Mountains, has declared war against the Boers.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sikukuni wants rifles for his men, such as the Boers use. He has heard
of the Inkosis hunting here. To-night he will send an Impi to kill the Inkosis
and take their guns.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;These are the words of the Intombi?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Inkoos, these are her very words. She was sitting outside the hut,
grinding &lsquo;imphi&rsquo; (Kafir corn) for beer, when she heard
Secocoeni&rsquo;s messenger order her father to call the men together to kill
us to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear. At what time of the night was the killing to be?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At the first break of the dawn, so that they may have light to take the
waggon away by.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! we shall escape them. The moon will be up in an hour, and we can
trek away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lad&rsquo;s face fell.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alas!&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is impossible; there is a spy watching
the camp now. He is up there among the rocks; I saw him as I brought the oxen
home. If we move he will report it, and we shall be overtaken in an
hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston thought for a moment, and then made up his mind with the rapidity
that characterises men who spend their lives in dealing with savage races.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mazooku!&rdquo; he called to a Zulu who was sitting smoking by the
camp-fire, a man whom Ernest had hired as his particular servant. The man rose
and came to him, and saluted.
</p>

<p>
He was not a very tall man; but, standing there nude except for the
&ldquo;moocha&rdquo; round his centre, his proportions, especially those of the
chest and lower limbs, looked gigantic. He had been a soldier in one of
Cetywayo&rsquo;s regiments, but having been so indiscreet as to break through
some of the Zulu marriage laws, had been forced to fly for refuge to Natal,
where he had become a groom, and picked up a peculiar language, which he called
English. Even among a people where all the men are fearless he bore a
reputation for bravery. Leaving him standing awhile, Mr. Alston rapidly
explained the state of the case to Ernest, and what he proposed to do. Then
turning, he addressed the Zulu:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mazooku, the Inkoos here, your master, whom you black people have named
Mazimba, tells me that he thinks you a brave man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Zulu&rsquo;s handsome face expanded into a smile that was positively
alarming in its extent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He says that you told him that when you were Cetywayo&rsquo;s man in the
Undi Regiment, you once killed four Basutos, who set upon you together.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mazooku lifted his right arm and saluted, by way of answer, and then glanced
slightly at the assegai-wounds on his chest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I tell your master that I do not believe you. It is a lie you
speak to him; you ran away from Cetywayo because you did not like to fight and
be killed as the king&rsquo;s ox, as a brave man should.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Zulu coloured up under his dusky skin, and again glanced at his wounds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ow-w!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bah! there is no need for you to look at those scratches; they were left
by women&rsquo;s nails. You are nothing but a woman. Silence! who told you to
speak? If you are not a woman, show it. There is an armed Basutu among those
rocks. He watches us. Your master cannot eat and sleep in peace when he is
watched. Take that big stabbing assegai you are so fond of showing, and kill
him, or die a coward! He must make no sound, remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mazooku turned towards Ernest for confirmation of the order. A Zulu always
likes to take his orders straight from his own chief. Mr. Alston noticed it,
and added:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am the Inkoosi&rsquo;s mouth, and speak his words.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mazooku saluted again, and turning, went to the waggon to fetch his assegai.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tread softly, or you will wake him; and he will run from so great a
man,&rdquo; Mr. Alston called after him sarcastically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I go among the rocks to seek &lsquo;mouti&rsquo;&rdquo; (medicine), the
Zulu answered with a smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We are in a serious mess, my boy,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston to Ernest,
&ldquo;and it is a toss-up if we get out of it. I taunted that fellow so that
there may be no mistake about the spy. He must be killed, and Mazooku would
rather die himself than not kill him now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would it not have been safer to send another man with him?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but I was afraid that if the scout saw two men coming towards him
he would make off, however innocent they might look. Our horses are dead, and
if that fellow escapes we shall never get out of this place alive. It would be
folly to expect Basutos to distinguish between Boers and Englishmen when their
blood is up; and besides, Secocoeni has sent orders that we are to be killed,
and they would not dare to disobey. Look, there goes Mr. Mazooku with an
assegai as big as a fire-shovel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The kopje, or stony hill, where the spy was hid, was about three hundred yards
from the little hollow in which the camp was formed, and across the stretch of
bushy plain between the two Mazooku was quietly strolling, his assegai in one
hand and two long sticks in the other. Presently he vanished in the shadow, for
the sun was rapidly setting, and, after what seemed a long pause to Ernest, who
was watching his movements through a pair of field-glasses, reappeared walking
along the shoulder of the hill right against the sky-line, his eyes fixed upon
the ground as though he were searching among the crevices of the rocks for the
medical herbs which Zulus prize.
</p>

<p>
All of a sudden Ernest saw the stalwart form straighten itself and spring down
into a dip, which hid it from sight, with the assegai in its hand raised to the
level of its head. Then came a pause, lasting perhaps for twenty seconds. On
the farther side of the dip was a large flat rock, which was straight in a line
with the fiery ball of the setting sun. Suddenly a tall figure sprang up out of
the hollow on to this rock, followed by another figure, in whom Ernest
recognised Mazooku. For a moment the two men, looking from their position like
people afire, struggled together on the top of the flat stone, and Ernest could
clearly distinguish the quick flash of their spears as they struck at each
other; then they vanished together over the edge of the stone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Ernest, who was trembling with excitement, &ldquo;I
wonder how it has ended?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;We shall know presently,&rdquo; answered Mr. Alston, coolly. &ldquo;At
any rate, the die is cast one way or other, and we may as well make a bolt for
it. Now, you Zulus, down with those tents and get the oxen inspanned, and look
quick about it, if you don&rsquo;t want a Basutu assegai to send you to join
the spirit of Chaka.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The voorlooper Jim had by this time communicated his alarming intelligence to
the driver and other Kafirs, and Mr. Alston&rsquo;s exhortation to look sharp
was quite unnecessary. Ernest never saw camp struck or oxen inspanned with such
rapidity before. But before the first tent was fairly down, they were all
enormously relieved to see Mazooku coming trotting cheerfully across the plain,
droning a little Zulu song as he ran. His appearance, however, was by no means
cheerful, for he was perfectly drenched with blood, some of it flowing from a
wound in his left shoulder, and the rest evidently, till recently, the personal
property of somebody else. Arrived in front of where Mr. Alston and Ernest were
standing, he raised his broad assegai, which was still dripping blood, and
saluted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have done the Inkoosi Mazimba&rsquo;s bidding. There were two of them;
the first I killed easily in the hollow, but the other, a very big man, fought
well for a Basutu. They are dead, and I threw them into a hole, that their
brothers might not find them easily.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! go wash yourself and get your master&rsquo;s things into the
waggon. Stop! let me sew up that cut. How came you to be so awkward as to get
touched by a Basutu?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inkoos, he was very quick with his spear, and he fought like a
cat.&rdquo; Mr. Alston did not reply, but, taking a stout needle and some silk
from a little housewife he carried in his pocket, he quickly stitched up the
assegai-gash, which, fortunately, was not a deep one. Mazooku stood without
flinching till the job was finished, and then retired to wash himself at the
spring.
</p>

<p>
The short twilight rapidly faded into darkness, or rather into what would have
been darkness, had it not been for the half-grown moon, which was to serve to
light them on their path. Then, a large fire having been lit on the site of the
camp to make it appear as though it were still pitched there, the order was
given to start. The oxen, obedient to the voice of the driver, strained at the
trek-tow, the waggon creaked and jolted, and they began their long flight for
life. The order of march was as follows: Two hundred yards ahead of the waggon
walked a Kafir, with strict orders to keep his eyes very wide open indeed, and
report in the best way possible, under the circumstances, if he detected any
signs of an ambush. At the head of the long line of cattle, leading the two
front oxen by a &ldquo;reim,&rdquo; or strip of buffalo-hide, was the Zulu boy
Jim, to whose timely discovery they owed their lives, and by the side of the
waggon the driver, a Cape Hottentot, plodded along in fear and trembling. On
the waggon-box itself, each with a Winchester repeating rifle on his knees, and
keeping a sharp lookout into the shadows, sat Mr. Alston and Ernest. In the
hinder part of the waggon, also armed with a rifle and keeping a keen look-out,
sat Mazooku. The other servants marched alongside, and the boy Roger was asleep
inside, on the &ldquo;cartle,&rdquo; or hide bed.
</p>

<p>
And so they travelled on hour after hour. Now they bumped down terrific hills
strewn with boulders, which would have smashed anything less solid than an
African ox-waggon to splinters; now they crept along a dark valley, that looked
spiritual and solemn in the moonlight, expecting to see Secocoeni&rsquo;s Impi
emerge from every clump of bush; and now again they waded through
mountain-streams. At last, about midnight, they reached a plain dividing two
stretches of mountainous country, and here they halted for a while to give the
oxen, which were fortunately in good condition and fat after their long rest, a
short breathing-time. Then on again through the long, quiet night, on, still
on, till the dawn found them the other side of the wide plain at the foot of
the mountain-range.
</p>

<p>
Here they rested for two hours, and let the oxen fill themselves with the lush
grass. They had travelled thirty miles since the yokes were put upon their
necks&mdash;not far according to our way of journeying, but very far for
cumbersome oxen over an almost impassable country. As soon as the sun was well
up they inspanned again, and hurried forwards, bethinking them of the Basutu
horde who would now be pressing on their spoor; on with brief halts through all
that day and the greater part of the following night, till the cattle began to
fall down in the yokes&mdash;till at last they crossed the boundary and were in
Transvaal territory.
</p>

<p>
When dawn broke, Mr. Alston took the glasses and examined the track over which
they had fled. There was nothing to be seen except a great herd of hartebeest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that we are safe now,&rdquo; he said, at last, &ldquo;and thank
God for it. Do you know what those Basutu devils would have done if they had
caught us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They would have skinned us, and made our hearts and livers into
&lsquo;mouti&rsquo; (medicine), and eaten them to give them the courage of the
white man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove!&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap24"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
A HOMERIC COMBAT</h2>

<p>
When Mr. Alston and Ernest found themselves safe upon Transvaal soil, they
determined to give up the idea of following any more big game for the present,
and to content themselves with the comparatively humble wilderbeeste, blesbok,
springbok, and other small antelopes. The plan they pursued was to slowly
journey from one point of the country to another, stopping wherever they found
the buck particularly plentiful. In this way they got excellent sport, and
spent several months very agreeably, with the further advantage that Ernest
obtained considerable knowledge of the country and its inhabitants, the Boers.
</p>

<p>
It was a wild rough life that they led, but by no means a lowering one. The
continual contact with Nature in all her moods, and in her wildest shapes, to a
man of impressionable mind like Ernest, was an education in itself. His mind
absorbed something of the greatness round him, and seemed to grow wider and
deeper during those months of lonely travel. The long struggle, too, with the
hundred difficulties which arise in waggon-journeys, and the quickness of
decision necessary to avoid danger or discomfort in such a mode of life, were
of great service to him in shaping his character. Nor was he left without
suitable society, for in his companion he found a friend for whose talents and
intelligence he had the highest respect.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston was a very quiet individual; he never said a thing unless he had
first considered it in all its bearings; but when he did say it, it was always
well worth listening to. He was a man who had spent his life in the closest
observation of human nature in the rough. Now you, my reader, may think that
there is a considerable difference between human nature &ldquo;in the
rough,&rdquo; as exemplified by a Zulu warrior stalking out of his kraal in a
kaross and brandishing an assegai, and yourself, say, strolling up the steps of
your club in a frock coat, and twirling one of Brigg&rsquo;s umbrellas. But, as
a matter of fact, the difference is of a most superficial character, bearing
the same proportion to the common substance that the furniture polish does to
the table. Scratch the polish, and there you have best raw Zulu human nature.
Indeed, to anybody who has taken the trouble to study the question, it is
simply absurd to observe how powerless high civilisation has been to do
anything more than veneer that raw material, which remains identical in each
case.
</p>

<p>
To return. The result of Mr. Alston&rsquo;s observations had been to make him
an extremely shrewd companion, and an excellent judge of men and their affairs.
There were few subjects which he had not quietly considered during all the
years that he had been trading or shooting or serving the Government in one
capacity or another; and Ernest was astonished to find, although he had only
spent some four months of his life in England, how intimate was his knowledge
of the state of political parties, of the great social questions of the day,
and even of matters connected with literature and art. It is not too much to
say that it was from Mr. Alston that Ernest imbibed principles on all these
subjects which he never deserted in after-life, and which subsequent experience
proved to be for the most part sound.
</p>

<p>
And thus, between shooting and philosophical discussion, the time passed on
pleasantly enough, till at length they drew near to Pretoria, the capital of
the Transvaal, where they had decided to go and rest the oxen for a month or
two before making arrangements for a real big-game excursion up towards Central
Africa. They struck into the Pretoria road just above a town called Heidelberg,
about sixty miles from the former place, and proceeded by easy stages towards
their destination.
</p>

<p>
As they went on, they generally found it convenient to out-span at spots which
it was evident had been used for the same purpose by some waggon that was
travelling one stage ahead of them. So frequently did this happen, that during
their first five or six out-spans they were able on no less than three
occasions to avail themselves of the dying fires of their predecessors&rsquo;
camp. This was a matter of lively interest to Ernest, who always did cook; and
a very good cook he became. One of the great bothers of South African
travelling is the fire question. Indeed, how to make sufficient fire to boil a
kettle when you have no fuel to make it of is the great question of South
African travel. A ready-made fire is, therefore, peculiarly acceptable; and for
the last half-hour of the trek Ernest was always in a great state of
expectation as to whether the waggon before them had or had not been
considerate enough to leave theirs burning.
</p>

<p>
Thus it came to pass that one morning, when they were about fifteen miles from
Pretoria, which they expected to reach the same evening, and the waggon was
slowly drawing up to the outspan-place, Ernest, accompanied by Mazooku, who
lounged about after him like a black shadow, ran forward to see if their
predecessors had or had not been considerate. In this instance energy was
rewarded, for the fire was still burning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hoorah!&rdquo; said Ernest. &ldquo;Get the sticks, Mazooku, and go and
fill the kettle. By Jove! there&rsquo;s a knife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was a knife, a many-bladed knife, with a buck horn handle and a corkscrew
in it, left by the dying fire. Ernest took it up and looked at it; somehow it
seemed familiar to him. He turned it round, examined the silver plate upon it,
and suddenly started.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, Ernest?&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, who had joined them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look there,&rdquo; he answered; pointing to two initials cut on the
knife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I see some fellow has left his knife; so much the better for the
finder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have heard me speak of my friend Jeremy. That is his knife; I gave
it to him years ago. Look&mdash;J. J.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! it is some knife like it; I have seen hundreds of that
make.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe that it is the same. He must be here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston shrugged his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not probable,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Ernest made no answer. He stood staring at the knife.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you written to your people lately, Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No; the last letter I wrote was down there in Secocoeni&rsquo;s country;
you remember I sent it by the Basutu who was going to Lydenburg, just before
Jeffries died.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Like enough he never got to Lydenburg. He would not have dared to go to
Lydenburg after the war broke out. You should write.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean to, from Pretoria; but somehow I have had no heart for
writing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Nothing more was said about the matter, and Ernest put the knife into his
pocket.
</p>

<p>
That evening they trekked down through the &ldquo;Poort&rdquo; that commands
the most charming of the South African towns, and, on the plain below,
Pretoria, bathed in the bright glow of the evening sunshine, smiled its welcome
to them. Mr. Alston, who knew the town, determined to trek straight through it
and outspan the waggon on the farther side, where he thought there would be
better grazing for the cattle. Accordingly, they rumbled on past the gaol, past
the pleasant white building which afterwards became Government House, and which
was at that moment occupied by the English Special Commissioner and his staff,
about whose doings all sorts of rumours had reached them during their journey,
and on to the market-square. This area was at the moment crowded with Boer
waggons, whose owners had trekked in to celebrate their &ldquo;nachtmaal&rdquo;
(communion), of which it is their habit, in company with their wives and
children, to partake four times a year. The &ldquo;Volksraad,&rdquo; or local
Parliament, was also in special session to consider the proposals made to it on
behalf of the Imperial Government, so that the little town was positively
choked with visitors. The road down which they were passing ran past the
buildings used as Government offices, and between this and the Dutch church a
considerable crowd was gathered, which, to judge from the shouts and volleys of
oaths&mdash;Dutch and English&mdash;that proceeded from it, was working itself
up into a state of excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold on,&rdquo; shouted Ernest to the voorlooper; and then, turning to
Mr. Alston, &ldquo;There is a jolly row going on there; let us go and see what
it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, my boy; where the fighting is, there will the Englishmen be
gathered together;&rdquo; and they climbed down off the waggon and made for the
crowd.
</p>

<p>
The row was this. Among the Boers assembled for the &ldquo;nachtmaal&rdquo;
festival was a well-known giant of the name of Van Zyl. This man&rsquo;s
strength was a matter of public notoriety all over the country, and many were
the feats which were told of him. Among others it was said that he could bear
the weight of the after-part of an African buck waggon on his shoulders, with a
load of three thousand pounds of corn upon it, while the wheels were greased.
He stood about six feet seven high, weighed eighteen stone and a half, and had
a double row of teeth. On the evening in question this remarkable specimen of
humanity was sitting on his waggon-box with a pipe, of which the size was
proportionate to his own, clinched firmly between his double row of teeth.
About ten paces from him stood a young Englishman, also of large size, though
he looked quite small beside the giant, who was contemplating the phenomenon on
the waggon-box, and wondering how many inches he measured round the chest. That
young Englishman had just got off a newly arrived waggon, and his name was
Jeremy Jones.
</p>

<p>
To these advances a cringing Hottentot boy of small size. The Hottentot is
evidently the servant or slave of the giant, and a man standing by Jeremy, who
understands Dutch, informs him that he is telling his master that an ox has
strayed. Slowly the giant rouses himself, and, descending from the waggon-box,
seizes the trembling Tottie with one hand, and, taking a reim of buftalo-hide,
lashes him to the waggon-wheel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; remarked Jeremy&rsquo;s acquaintance, &ldquo;you will see
how a Boer deals with a nigger.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You don&rsquo;t mean to say that great brute is going to beat that poor
little devil?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then a small fat woman put her head out of a tent pitched by the waggon,
and inquired what the matter was. She was the giant&rsquo;s wife. On being
informed of the straying of the ox, her wrath knew no bounds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Slaat em! slaat de swartsel!&rdquo; (Thrash him! thrash the black
creature!) she cried out in a shrill voice, running to the waggon, and with her
own fair hands drawing out a huge &ldquo;sjambock,&rdquo; that is, a strip of
prepared hippopotamus-hide, used to drive the after-oxen with, and giving it to
her spouse. &ldquo;Cut the liver out of the black devil!&rdquo; she went on,
&ldquo;but mind you don&rsquo;t hit his head, or he won&rsquo;t be able to go
to work afterwards. Never mind about making the blood come! I have got lots of
salt to rub in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Her harangue, and the sight of the Hottentot tied to the wheel, had by this
time attracted quite a crowd of Boers and Englishmen who were idling about the
market-square.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Softly, Vrouw, softly; I will thrash enough to satisfy even you, and we
all know that must be very hard where a black creature is in question.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A roar of laughter from the Dutch people round greeted this sally of wit, and
the giant, taking the sjambock with a good-humoured smile&mdash;for, like most
giants, he was easy-tempered by nature&mdash;lifted it, whirled his great arm,
thick as the leg of an average man, round his head, and brought the whip down
on the back of the miserable Hottentot. The poor wretch yelled with pain, and
no wonder, for the greasy old shirt he wore was divided clean in two, together
with the skin beneath it, and the blood was pouring from the gash.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Allamachter! dat is een lecker slaat&rdquo; (Almighty! that was a nice
one), said the old woman; at which the crowd laughed again.
</p>

<p>
But there was one man who did not laugh, and that man was Jeremy. On the
contrary, his clear eyes flashed and his brown cheek burned with indignation.
Nor did he stop at that. Stepping forward, he placed himself between the giant
and the howling Hottentot, and said to the former, in the most nervous English:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are a damned coward!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Boer stared at him and smiled, and then, turning, asked what the
&ldquo;English fellow&rdquo; was saying. Somebody translated Jeremy&rsquo;s
remark, whereupon the Boer, who was not a bad-natured fellow, smiled again, and
remarked that Jeremy must be madder than the majority of &ldquo;accursed
Englishmen.&rdquo; Then he turned to continue thrashing the Hottentot, but, lo!
the mad Englishman was still there. This put the Dutchman out.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Footsack, carl; ik is Van Zyl!&rdquo; (Get out, fellow; I am Van Zyl!)
This was interpreted to Jeremy by the by-standers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right; and tell him that I am Jones, a name he may have heard
before,&rdquo; was the reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What does this brain-sick fellow want?&rdquo; shouted the giant.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy explained that he wanted him to stop his brutality. &ldquo;And what will
the little man do if I refuse?&rdquo; &ldquo;I shall try to make you,&rdquo;
was the answer. This remark was received with a shout of laughter from the
crowd which had now collected, in which the giant joined very heartily when it
was interpreted to him.
</p>

<p>
Giving Jeremy a shove to one side, he again lifted the great sjambock, with the
purpose of bringing it down on the Hottentot. Another second, and Jeremy had
snatched the whip from his hand, and sent it flying fifty yards away. Then,
realising that his antagonist was really in earnest, the great Dutchman
solemnly set himself to crush him. Doubling a fist which was the size of a
Welsh leg of mutton, he struck with all his strength straight at the
Englishman&rsquo;s head. Had the blow caught Jeremy, it would in all
probability have killed him; but he was a practised boxer, and, without moving
his body, he swung his head to one side. The Boer&rsquo;s fist passed him
harmlessly, and, striking the panel of the waggon, went clean through it. Next
instant several of the giant&rsquo;s double row of teeth were rolling loose in
his mouth. Jeremy had returned the stroke by a right-hander, into which he put
all his power, and which would have knocked any other man backwards.
</p>

<p>
A great shout from the assembled Englishmen followed this blow, and a
counter-shout from the crowd of Dutchmen, who pointed triumphantly to the hole
in the stout yellow-wood panel made by their champion&rsquo;s fist, and asked
who the madman was who dared to stand against him.
</p>

<p>
The Boer turned and spat out some of his superfluous teeth, and at the same
instant a young Englishman came and caught hold of Jeremy by the arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For Heaven&rsquo;s sake, my dear fellow, be careful! That man will kill
you; he is the strongest man in the Transvaal. You are a fellow to be proud of,
though!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He may try,&rdquo; said Jeremy laconically, stripping off his coat and
waistcoat. &ldquo;Will you hold these for me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hold them?&rdquo; answered the young fellow, who was a good sort;
&ldquo;ay, that I will, and I would give half I have to see you lick him. Dodge
him; don&rsquo;t let him strike you, or he will kill you. I saw him stun an ox
once with a blow of his fist.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Ask that coward, if I best him, if he win
let off that miserable beggar?&rdquo; and he pointed to the trembling
Hottentot.
</p>

<p>
The question was put, and the great man answered, &ldquo;Yah, yah! I will make
you a present of him!&rdquo; ironically, and then expressed his intention of
knocking Jeremy into small pieces in the course of the next two minutes.
</p>

<p>
Then they faced one another. The giant was a trifle over six feet seven high;
Jeremy was a trifle under six feet two and a half, and looked short beside him.
But one or two critical observers, looking at the latter now that he was
stripped for the encounter, shrewdly guessed that the Dutchman would have his
work cut out. Jeremy did not, it is true, scale more than fourteen stone six,
but his proportions were perfect. The great deep chest, the brawny
arms&mdash;not very large, but a mass of muscle&mdash;the short strong neck,
the quick eye, and massive leg, all bespoke the strength of a young Hercules.
It was evident, too, that though he was so young, and not yet come to his full
power, he was in the most perfect training. The Boer, on the other hand, was
enormous, but his flesh was somewhat soft. Still, knowing his feats, the
Englishmen present sighed for their champion, feeling that he had no chance.
</p>

<p>
For a moment they stood facing each other; then Jeremy made a feint, and,
getting in, planted a heavy blow with his left hand on his adversary&rsquo;s
chest. But he was to pay for it, for the next second the Dutchman got in his
right hand, and Jeremy was lifted clean off his feet, and sent flying backwards
among the crowd.
</p>

<p>
The Boers cheered, the giant smiled, and the Englishmen looked sad. They knew
how it would be.
</p>

<p>
But Jeremy picked himself up little the worse. The stroke had struck the
muscles of his chest, and had not hurt him greatly. As he advanced, the
gradually increasing crowd of Englishmen cheered him warmly, and he swore in
his heart that he would justify those cheers, or die for it.
</p>

<p>
It was at this juncture that Ernest and Mr. Alston came up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed the former; &ldquo;it is Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston took in the situation at a glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let him see you; you will put him off,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;Get behind me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest obeyed, overwhelmed. Mr. Alston shook his head. He recognised that
Jeremy had a poor chance, but he did not say so to Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Jeremy came up and faced the Dutchman. Encouraged by his late
success, presently his adversary struck a tremendous blow at him. Jeremy
dodged, and next instant succeeded in landing such a fearful right and left
full on the giant&rsquo;s face that the latter went reeling backwards.
</p>

<p>
A yell of frantic excitement arose from the English portion of the crowd. This
was indeed a David.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus08"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig08.jpg" width="408" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;This was indeed a David.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
The Dutchman soon recovered, however, and, rendered more cautious, in his turn,
kept out of Jeremy&rsquo;s reach, trying to strike him down from a distance.
For a round or two no important blow was struck, till at last a brilliant idea
took possession of the young fellow who had charge of Jeremy&rsquo;s coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hit him about the body,&rdquo; he whispered; &ldquo;he&rsquo;s
soft.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy took the advice, and next round succeeded in getting in two or three
blows straight from the shoulder, every one of which bruised the Boer&rsquo;s
huge body sadly, and made him rather short of wind.
</p>

<p>
Next round he repeated the same tactics, receiving himself a stroke on the
shoulder from Van Zyl&rsquo;s right hand that for a moment rendered his left
arm helpless. Before another second was over, however, Jeremy had his revenge,
and the blood was pouring from his adversary&rsquo;s lips.
</p>

<p>
And now the popular excitement on both sides grew intense, for to the interest
attaching to the encounter was added that of national feeling, which was then
at a high state of tension. Englishmen, Dutchmen, and a mob of Kafirs yelled
and shouted, and each of the former two felt that the honour of his people was
on the issue. And yet it was an unequal fight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I believe that your friend will be a match for Van Zyl,&rdquo; said Mr.
Alston, coolly, but the flash of his eye belied his coolness; &ldquo;and I tell
you what, he&rsquo;s a devilish fine fellow, too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment, however, an untoward thing happened. The giant struck out his
strongest, and Jeremy could not succeed in entirely warding off the blow,
though he broke its force. Crashing through his guard, it struck him on the
forehead, and for a moment he dropped senseless. His second rushed up and
dashed some water over him, and in another instant he was on his legs again;
but for the rest of that round he contented himself with dodging his
adversary&rsquo;s attack, at which the Dutchmen cheered, thinking that his iron
strength was broken.
</p>

<p>
But presently, when for the sixth time Jeremy came up with the same quiet look
of determination in his eyes, and, except that the gaping of the nostrils and
the twitching of the lip showed a certain measure of distress, looking but
little the worse, they turned with anxiety to examine the condition of the
giant. It was not very promising. He was perspiring profusely, and his enormous
chest rose and fell in jerks. Wherever Jeremy&rsquo;s strokes had fallen, also,
a great blue bruise had risen on his flesh. It was evident that his condition
was the worse of the two, but still the Boers had little doubt of the issue. It
could not be that the man could be worsted by an English lad, who, for a bet,
with one hand had once quelled the struggles of a wild ox, holding it for the
space of five minutes by the horn. So they called on him to stop playing with
the English boy, and crush him.
</p>

<p>
Thus encouraged, the giant came on, striking out with fearful force, but
wildly, for he could not box. For thirty seconds or more Jeremy contented
himself with avoiding the blows; then, seeing an opportunity, he planted a
heavy one on his adversary&rsquo;s chest. This staggered Van Zyl and threw him
off his guard, and, taking the offensive, Jeremy dodged in right under the huge
fists that beat the air above him, and hit upwards with all his power. Thud,
thud! The sound of the blows could be heard fifty yards off. Nor were they
without their effect. The giant staggered, threw up his arms, and, amidst
fearful shouts and groans, fell like an ox struck with a pole-axe. But it was
not over yet. In another moment he was on his legs again, and, spitting out
blood and teeth, whirling his hands like the sails of a windmill, reeled
straight at Jeremy, a fearful and alarming spectacle. As he came, again Jeremy
hit him in the face, but it did not stop him, and in another second the huge
arms had closed round him and held him like a vice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not fair! no holding!&rdquo; shouted the Englishmen; but the Boer held
on. Indeed, he did more. Putting all his vast strength into the effort, he
strained and tugged, meaning to lift Jeremy up and dash him on the ground. But
lo! amid frantic shouts from the crowd, Jeremy stood firm, moving not an inch,
whereupon the Boers called out, saying that he was not a mortal, but a man
possessed with a devil! Again the Dutchman gripped him, and this time succeeded
in lifting him a few inches from the ground.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By George, he will throw him next time!&rdquo; said Mr. Alston to
Ernest, who was shaking like a leaf with the excitement; &ldquo;look!&mdash;he
is turning white; the grip is choking him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And, indeed, Jeremy was in evil case; his senses were fast being crushed out of
him in that fearful embrace, and he vas thinking with bitter sorrow that he
must fail after all, for an Englishman does not like to be beaten even when he
has fought his best. Just then it was, when things were beginning to swim
around him, that a voice he loved, and which he had been listening for these
many months, rang in his ears; whether it was fancy or whether he really heard
it he knew not.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Remember &lsquo;Marsh Joe,&rsquo; Jeremy, and <i>lift him.</i>
Don&rsquo;t be beat. For God&rsquo;s sake, lift him!&rdquo; said the voice.
</p>

<p>
Now there was a trick, which I will not tell you, but which a famous Eastern
Counties&rsquo; wrestler, known as Marsh Joe, had taught to Jeremy. So well had
he taught him, indeed, that at the age of seventeen Jeremy had hoisted his
teacher with his own trick.
</p>

<p>
Just at the moment that Jeremy heard the voice, the giant shifted his hold a
little, preparatory to making a fresh effort, and thus enabled his antagonist
to fill his lungs with air. Ernest saw the broad white chest heave with relief,
for by this time most of the upper clothing of the combatants had been wrenched
away, and the darkening eye grow bright again, and he knew that Jeremy had
heard him, and that he would conquer or die where he was.
</p>

<p>
And then&mdash;lo, and behold! just as the Boer, feeling that at last he was
master of the situation, leisurely enough prepared himself for the final
struggle, suddenly the Englishman advanced his right leg a few inches, and with
the rapidity of lightning entirely shifted his grip. Then he gathered himself
for the effort. What secret reserve of strength he drew on, who can say? But
Ernest&rsquo;s voice had excited it, and it came at his call: and he did a
thing that few living men could have done, and the fame of which will go down
in South Africa from generation to generation. For the Englishman&rsquo;s lithe
arms had found their hold; they tightened and gripped till they sunk in almost
level with the flesh of his mighty foe. Then slowly Jeremy began to gather
purchase, swaying backwards and forwards, and the Dutchman swayed with him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make an end of him! make an end of him!&rdquo; shouted the Boers. But
behold! their champion&rsquo;s eyes are starting from his blackened face; his
head sinks lower and lower, his buttocks rise: he cannot stir.
</p>

<p>
To and fro sways Jeremy, and now the giant&rsquo;s feet are lifted from the
ground. And then one slow and mighty effort&mdash;oh, gallant Jeremy!&mdash;up,
still up above the gasping of the wonder-stricken crowd, up to his shoulders,
Heaven, over it!
</p>

<p>
Crash!
</p>

<p>
Van Zyl fell, to be carried away by six strong men a cripple for life.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap25"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>
ERNEST&rsquo;S LOVE-LETTER</h2>

<p>
Cheer after cheer arose from the Englishmen around, and angry curses from the
Dutchmen, as Jeremy turned to look at the senseless carcass of the giant. But,
even as he turned, exhausted Nature gave out, and he fell fainting into
Ernest&rsquo;s arms.
</p>

<p>
Then did selected individuals of his fellow-countrymen come forward and bear
him reverently to a restaurant called the &ldquo;European,&rdquo; where the
proprietor&mdash;himself an old Eton fellow&mdash;met him, and washed and
clothed and restored him, and vowed with tears in his eyes that he, Jeremy,
should live at his expense for as long as he liked&mdash;ay, even if he chose
to drink nothing meaner than champagne all day long; for thus it is that
Englishmen greet one who ministers to that deepest rooted of all their
feelings&mdash;national pride. And then, when at length he had been brought to,
and refreshed with a tumblerful of dry Monopole, and wonderingly shaken Ernest
by the hand, the enthusiasm of the crowd outside burst its bounds, and they
poured into the restaurant, and, seizing Jeremy and the chair whereon he sat,
they bore him in triumph round the market-square to the tune of &ldquo;God save
the Queen.&rdquo; This was a proceeding that would have ended in provoking a
riot had not an aide-de-camp from his Excellency the Special Commissioner, who
sent a message begging that they would desist, succeeded in persuading them to
return to the restaurant. And here they all dined, and forced Jeremy to drink a
great deal more dry Monopole than was good for him, with the result that for
the first and last time in his life he was persuaded into making an
after-dinner speech. As far as it was reported it ran something like this:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear friends&rdquo; (cheers) &ldquo;and Englishmen&rdquo; (renewed
cheers)&mdash;pause&mdash;&rdquo; all making great fuss about nothing&rdquo;
(cheers, and shouts of &ldquo;No, no!&rdquo;). &ldquo;Fight the Dutchman again
to-morrow&mdash;very big, but soft as putty&mdash;anybody fight him&rdquo;
(frantic cheering). &ldquo;Glad I wasn&rsquo;t thrashed, as you all seem so
pleased. Don&rsquo;t know why you are pleased; &rsquo;spose you didn&rsquo;t
like the Dutchman. &rsquo;Fraid he hurt himself over my shoulder. Wonder what
he did it for? Sit down now. Dear friends, dear old Ernest&mdash;been looking
for you for long while;&rdquo; and he turned his glassy eye on to Ernest, who
cheered frantically, under the impression that Jeremy had just said something
very much to the point. &ldquo;Sit down now&rdquo; (&ldquo;No, no; go
on&rdquo;). &ldquo;Can&rsquo;t go on&mdash;&rdquo; quite pumped&mdash;very
thirsty, too&rdquo; (&ldquo;Give him some more champagne; open a fresh
case&rdquo;). &ldquo;Wish Eva and Doll were here, don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo; (loud
cheers). &ldquo;Gemman&rdquo; (cheers)&mdash;&ldquo;no, not
gemman&mdash;friends&rdquo; (louder cheers)&mdash;&ldquo;no, not
gemman&mdash;friends&mdash;English brothers&rdquo; (yet louder cheers),
&ldquo;I give you a toast. Eva and Doll: you all know &rsquo;em and love
&rsquo;em, or if you don&rsquo;t you would, you see, if you did, you
know.&rdquo; (Frantic outburst of cheering, during which Jeremy tries to resume
his seat, but gracefully drops on to the floor, and begins singing &ldquo;Auld
lang syne&rdquo; under the table; whereupon the whole company rise, and with
the exception of Ernest and a jovial member of the Special Commissioner&rsquo;s
staff, who get upon the table to lead the chorus, join hands and sing that
beautiful old song with all the solemnity of intoxication; after which they
drink more champagne, and jointly and severally swear eternal friendship,
especially Ernest and the member of his Excellency&rsquo;s staff, who shake
hands and bless each other, till the warmth of their emotions proves too much
for them, and they weep in chorus there upon the table.)
</p>

<p>
For the rest, Ernest had some vague recollection of helping to drive his newly
found friend home in a wheelbarrow that would persist in upsetting in every
&ldquo;sluit&rdquo; or ditch, especially if it had running water in it; and
that was about all he did remember.
</p>

<p>
In the morning he woke up, or rather first became conscious of pain in his
head, in a little double-bedded room attached to the hotel. On the pillow of
the bed opposite to him lay Jeremy&rsquo;s battered face.
</p>

<p>
For a while Ernest could make nothing of all this. Why was Jeremy there? Where
were they? Everything turned round and seemed phantasmagorial; the only real,
substantial thing was that awful pain in the head. But presently things began
to come back to him, and the sight of Jeremy&rsquo;s bruised face recalled the
fight, and the fight recalled the dinner, and the dinner brought back a vague
recollection of Jeremy&rsquo;s speech and of something he had said about Eva.
What could it have been? Ah, Eva! Perhaps Jeremy knew something about her;
perhaps he had brought the letter that had been so long in coming. O, how his
heart went out towards her! But how came Jeremy there in bed before him? how
came he to be in South Africa at all?
</p>

<p>
At that moment his reflections were interrupted by the entry of Mazooku,
bearing the coffee which it is the national habit in South Africa to drink
early in the morning.
</p>

<p>
The martial-looking Zulu, who seemed curiously out of place carrying cups of
coffee, seeing that his master was awake, saluted him with the customary
&ldquo;Koos,&rdquo; lifting one of the cups of coffee to give emphasis to the
word, and nearly upsetting it in the effort.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mazooku,&rdquo; said Ernest, severely, &ldquo;how did we get
here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The substance of the retainer&rsquo;s explanation was as follows: When the moon
was getting low&mdash;vanishing, indeed, behind the &ldquo;horned house&rdquo;
yonder (the Dutch church with pinnacles on it), it occurred to him, waiting on
the verandah, that his master must be weary; and as most had departed from the
&ldquo;dance&rdquo; in the &ldquo;tin house&rdquo; (restaurant), evidently made
happy by the &ldquo;twala&rdquo; (drink), he entered into the tin house to look
for him, and found him overcome by sleep under the table, lying next to the
&ldquo;Lion-who-threw-oxen-over-his-shoulder&rdquo; (i.e., Jeremy), so overcome
by sleep, indeed, that it was quite impossible to conduct him to the waggon.
This being so, he (Mazooku) considered what was his duty under the
circumstances, and he came to the accurate conclusion that the best thing to do
was to put them into the white man&rsquo;s bed, since he knew that his master
did not love the floor to lie on. Accordingly, having discovered that this was
a room of beds, he and another Zulu entered, but were perplexed to find the
beds already occupied by two white men, who had lain down to rest with their
clothes on. But, under all these circumstances, he and the other Zulu,
considering that their first thought should be towards their own master, had
taken the liberty of lifting up the two white men, who were slumbering
profoundly after the &ldquo;dance,&rdquo; by the head and by the heels, and
putting them out in the sweet cool air of the night, leaving thus &ldquo;made a
place,&rdquo; they then conveyed first Ernest, and having removed his clothes,
put him into one bed, and next, in consideration of his undoubted greatness,
they ventured to take the &ldquo;Lion-who, &amp;c.,&rdquo; himself, and put him
in the other. He was a very great man, the &ldquo;Lion,&rdquo; and his art of
throwing greater men over his shoulder could only be attributed to witchcraft.
He himself (Mazooku) had tried it on that morning with a Basutu, with whom he
had a slight difference of opinion, but the result had not been all that could
be desired, inasmuch as the Basutu had kicked him in the stomach, and forced
him to drop him.
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed as heartily as his headache would allow at this story, and in
doing so woke up Jeremy, who at once clapped his hands to his head and looked
round; whereupon Mazooku, having saluted the awakened &ldquo;Lion-who,
&amp;c.,&rdquo; with much fervour, and spilled a considerable quantity of hot
coffee over him in doing so, took his departure abashed, and at length the two
friends were left alone. Thereupon, rising from their respective pallets, they
took a step in all the glory of their undress uniform into the middle of the
little room, and, after the manner of Englishmen, shook hands and called each
other &ldquo;old fellow.&rdquo; Then they went back to bed and began to
converse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, old fellow, what on earth brought you out here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you see, I came out to look you up. You did not write any letters,
and they began to get anxious about you at home, so I packed up my duds and
started. Your uncle stands unlimited tin, so I am travelling like a prince in a
waggon of my own. I heard of you down in Maritzburg, and guessed that I had
best make for Pretoria; and here I am and there you are, and I am devilish glad
to see you again, old chap. By Jove, what a head I have! But, I say, why
didn&rsquo;t you write? Doll half broke her heart about it, and so did your
uncle, only he would not say so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did write. I wrote from Secocoeni&rsquo;s country, but I suppose the
letter did not fetch,&rdquo; answered Ernest, feeling very guilty. &ldquo;The
fact is, old fellow, I had not the heart to write much; I have been so
confoundedly down on my luck ever since that duel business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah!&rdquo; interposed Jeremy, &ldquo;that shot was a credit to you. I
didn&rsquo;t think you could have done it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A credit! I&rsquo;ll tell you what, it is an awful thing to kill a man
like that. I often see his face as he fell, at night in my sleep.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was merely looking at it as a shot,&rdquo; replied Jeremy, innocently,
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t trouble myself with moral considerations, which are
topsy-turvy sort of things; and, considered as a shot at twenty paces and under
trying circumstances, it was a credit to you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then, you see, Jeremy, there was another thing, you
know&mdash;about&mdash;about Eva. Well, I wrote to her, and she has never
answered my letter, unless,&rdquo; with a gleam of hope, &ldquo;you have
brought an answer.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy shook his aching head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! no such luck. Well, it put me off, and that&rsquo;s the fact. Since
she has chucked me up, I don&rsquo;t care twopence about anything. I
don&rsquo;t say but what she is right; I daresay that I am not worth sticking
to. She can do much better elsewhere;&rdquo; and Ernest groaned, and thought
that his head was very bad indeed. &ldquo;But there it is. I hadn&rsquo;t the
heart to write any more letters, and I was too proud to write again to her.
Confound her! let her go! I am not going to grovel to any woman under heaven,
no, not even to her!&rdquo; and he kicked the bedclothes viciously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I haven&rsquo;t learned much Zulu yet,&rdquo; replied Jeremy,
sententiously; &ldquo;but I know two words&mdash;&lsquo;hamba
gachlé.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, what of them?&rdquo; said Ernest, testily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They mean, I am told, &lsquo;take it easy,&rsquo; or &lsquo;look before
you leap,&rsquo; or &lsquo;never jump to conclusions,&rsquo; or
&lsquo;don&rsquo;t be in a confounded hurry&rsquo;; &ldquo;very fine mottoes, I
think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course they do; but what have they got to do with Eva?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, just this: I said I had got no letter; I never said&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What?&rdquo; shouted Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hamba gachlé,&rdquo; replied Jeremy, the imperturbable, gazing at Ernest
out of his blackened eyes. &ldquo;I never said that I had not got a
message.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest sprang clean out of the little truckle-bed, shaking with excitement.
&ldquo;What is it, man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Just this. She told me to tell you that she &lsquo;loved you
dearly.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly Ernest sat down on the bed again, and, throwing a blanket over his head
and shoulders, remarked, in a tone befitting a sheeted ghost:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The devil she did! Why couldn&rsquo;t you say so before?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then he got up again and commenced walking, blanket and all, up and down the
little room with long strides, and knocking over the water-jug in his
excitement.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hamba gachlé,&rdquo; again remarked Jeremy, rising and picking up the
water-jug. &ldquo;How are we going to get any more water? I&rsquo;ll tell you
all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And he did, including the story of Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s shaking, at which Ernest
chuckled fiercely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I had been there to kick him,&rdquo; he remarked,
parenthetically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I did that too; I kicked him hard,&rdquo; put in Jeremy; at which Ernest
chuckled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can&rsquo;t make it all out,&rdquo; said Ernest, at length, &ldquo;but
I will go home at once.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can&rsquo;t do that, old fellow. Your respected uncle, Sir Hugh,
will have you run in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I forgot! Well, I will write to her to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s better; and now let&rsquo;s dress. My head is rather
clearer. By George, though, I am stiff! It is no joke fighting a giant.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Ernest answered not a word. He was already, after his quick-brained
fashion, employed in concocting his letter to Eva.
</p>

<p>
In the course of the morning he drafted it. It, or rather that part of it with
which we need concern ourselves, ran thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Such then, my dearest Eva, was the state of my mind towards you. I
thought&mdash;God forgive me for the treason!&mdash;that perhaps you were, as
so many women are, a fairweather lover, and that now that I am in trouble you
wished to slip the cable. If that was so, I felt that it was not for me to
remonstrate. I wrote to you, and I knew that the letter came safely to your
hands. You did not answer it, and I could only come to one conclusion. Hence my
own silence. And to be plain I do not at this moment quite understand why you
have never written. But Jeremy has brought me your message, and with that I
must be content; for no doubt you have reasons which are satisfactory to
yourself, and if that is so, no doubt, too, they would be equally satisfactory
to me if I only knew them. You see, my dearest love, the fact is that I trust
and believe in you utterly and entirely. What is right and true, what is loyal
and sincere to me and to yourself&mdash;those are the things that you will do.
Jeremy tells me a rather amusing story about the new clergyman who has come to
Kesterwick, and who is, it appears, an aspirant for your hand. Well, Eva, I am
sufficiently conceited not to be jealous; although I am in the unlucky position
of an absent man, and worse still, an absent man under a cloud, I do not
believe that he will cut me out. But on the day that you can put your hand upon
your heart, and look me straight in the eyes, and tell me, on your honour as a
lady, that you love this or any other man better than you do me, on that day I
shall be ready to resign you to him. But till that day comes&mdash;and there is
something which tells me that it is as impossible for it to come as for the
mountain-range I look on as I write to move towards the town and bury
it&mdash;I am free from jealousy, for I know that it is impossible that you
should be faithless to your love.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, my sweet, the troth we plighted was not for days, or years, or
times&mdash;it was for ever. I believe that nothing can dissolve it, and that
Death himself will be powerless against it. I believe that with each new and
progressive existence it will re-arise as surely as the flowers in spring,
only, unlike them, more fragrant and beautiful than before. Sometimes I think
that it has already existed through countless ages. Strange thoughts come into
a man&rsquo;s mind out there on the great veldt, riding alone hour after hour,
and day after day, through sunlight and through moonlight, till the spirit of
Nature broods upon him, and he begins to learn the rudiments of truth. Some day
I shall tell them all to you. Not that <i>I</i> have ever been quite alone, for
I can say honestly that you have always been at my side since I left you; there
has been no hour of the day or night when you have not been in my thoughts, and
I believe that, till death blots out my senses, no such hour will ever come.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Day by day, too, my love has grown stronger even in its despair. Day by
day it has taken shape and form and colour, and become more and more a living
thing, more and more an entity, as distinct as soul and body, and yet as
inextricably blended and woven into the substance of each. If ever a woman was
beloved, you are that woman, Eva Ceswick; if ever a man&rsquo;s life, present
and to come, lay in a woman&rsquo;s hands, my life lies in yours. It is a germ
which you can cast away or destroy, or which you can nourish till it bursts
into bloom, and bears fruit beautiful beyond imagining. You are my fate, my
other part. With you my destiny is intertwined, and you can mould it as you
will. There is no height to which I cannot rise by your side; there is no depth
to which I may not sink without you.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, what does all this lead up to? Will you make a sacrifice for
me, who am ready to give all my life to you&mdash;no, who have already given
it? That sacrifice is this: I want you to come out here and marry me; for, as
you know, circumstances prevent me from returning to you. If you will come, I
will meet you at the Cape, and marry you there. Ah, surely you will come! As
for money, I have plenty from home, and can make as much more as we shall want
here, so that need be no obstacle. It is long to wait for your
answer&mdash;three months&mdash;but I hope that the faith that will, as the
Bible tells us, enable people to move mountains&mdash;and my faith in you is as
great as that&mdash;will also enable me to bear the suspense, and in the end
prove its own reward.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest read selected portions of this exalted composition to Mr. Alston and
Jeremy. Both listened in solemn silence, and at the conclusion Jeremy scratched
his head and remarked that it was deep enough to &ldquo;fetch&rdquo; any girl,
though for his part he did not quite understand it. Mr. Alston relit his pipe,
and for awhile said nothing; but to himself he thought that it was a remarkable
letter for so young a man to have written, and revealed a curious turn of mind.
One remark he did make, however, and that was rather a rude one:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The girl won&rsquo;t understand what you are driving at. Master Ernest;
she will think that you have gone off your head in these savage parts. All you
say may or may not be true&mdash;on that point I express no opinion; but to
write such things to a woman is to throw your pearls before swine. You should
ask her about her bonnets, my boy, and tell her what sort of dresses she should
bring out, and that the air is good for the complexion. She would come
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Ernest fired up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are beastly cynical, Alston, and you should not speak of Miss
Ceswick like that to me. Bonnets, indeed!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All light, my lad&mdash;all right. Time will show. Ah, you boys! you go
building up your ideals of ivory and gold and fine linen, only to find them one
day turned into the commonest of clay, draped in the dirtiest of rags. Well,
well, it is the way of the world; but you take my advice, Ernest: burn that
letter, and go in for an Intombi. It is not too late yet, and there is no
mistake about the sort of clay a Kafir girl is made of.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Ernest stamped out of the room in a passion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Too cock-sure, wanted cooling down a little,&rdquo; remarked Mr. Alston
to Jeremy; &ldquo;should never be cock-sure where a woman is concerned; women
are fond of playing dirty tricks, and saying they could not help it. I know
them; for, though you mightn&rsquo;t think it, I was once young myself. Come
on; let us go and find him, and go for a walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They found Ernest sitting on the box of the waggon, which was outspanned
together with Jeremy&rsquo;s, just outside the town, and looking rather sulky.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come on, Ernest,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, apologetically; &ldquo;I will
throw no more mud at your ideal. In the course of the last thirty years I have
seen so many fall to pieces of their own accord that I could not help warning
you. But perhaps they make them of better stuff in England than we do in these
parts.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest descended and soon forgot his pique. It was but rarely that he bore
malice for more than half an hour. As they walked along one of the by-streets
they met the young fellow who had acted as second to Jeremy in the big fight of
the previous day. He informed them that he had just been to inquire how the
giant was. It appeared that he had received an injury to the spine, the effect
of Jeremy&rsquo;s &ldquo;lift,&rdquo; from which there was little hope of his
recovery. He was not, however, in much pain. This intelligence distressed
Jeremy not a little. He had earnestly desired to thrash the giant, but he had
had no wish to injure him. With his usual promptitude he announced his
intention of going to see his fallen enemy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are likely to meet with a warm reception if you do,&rdquo; said Mr.
Alston.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I&rsquo;ll risk it. I should like to tell him that I am sorry.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good; come along&mdash;that is the house.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The injured man had been carried to the house of a relative just outside the
town, a white thatched building that had been built five-and-thirty years
before, when the site of Pretoria was a plain, inhabited only by quaggas,
eland, and vilderbeeste. In front of the door was a grove of orange-trees,
which smelled sweet and looked golden with hanging fruit.
</p>

<p>
The house itself was a small white building, with a double-swinging door, like
those used in stables in this country. The top half of the door was open, and
over the lower portion of it leaned a Boer, a rough-looking customer, smoking a
huge pipe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Dagh, Oom&rsquo;&rdquo; (Good-day, uncle), said Mr. Alston,
stretching out his hand.
</p>

<p>
The other looked at him suspiciously, and then held out a damp paw to each in
turn, at the same time opening the door. As Ernest passed the threshold he
noticed that the clay flooring was studded with peach-stones well trodden into
its substance to prevent wear and tear from passing feet. The door opened into
a fair-sized room with whitewashed walls called the &ldquo;sit-kam&rdquo; or
sitting-room, and furnished with a settee, a table, and several chairs seated
with &ldquo;rimpi,&rdquo; or strips of hide. On the biggest of these chairs sat
a woman of large size, the mother of the family. She did not rise on their
entry, but without speaking held out a limp hand, which Mr. Alston and the
others shook, addressing her affectionately as &ldquo;tanta,&rdquo; or aunt.
Then they shook hands with six or seven girls and young men, the latter sitting
about in an aimless sort of way, the former clearing off the remains of the
family meal, which had consisted of huge bones of boiled fresh beef. So fresh
was it, indeed, that on the floor by the side of the table lay the gory head
and skin of a newly killed ox, from which the beef had been cut. Ernest,
noticing this, wondered at the superhuman strength of stomach that could take
its food under such circumstances.
</p>

<p>
The preliminary ceremony of hand-shaking having been got through, Mr. Alston,
who spoke Dutch perfectly, explained the object of their visit. The faces of
the Dutchmen darkened as he did so, and the men scowled at Jeremy with hatred
not unmingled with terror. When he had done, the oldest man said that he would
ask his cousin if he would see them, adding, however, that he was so ill that
he did not think it likely. Raising a curtain, which served as a door, he
passed from the sitting-room into the bedroom, or &ldquo;slaap-kam.&rdquo;
Presently he returned, and beckoned to the Englishmen to enter. They passed
into a small chamber about ten feet square, which was hermetically sealed from
air, after the fashion of these people in cases of any illness. On a large bed
that blocked up most of the room, and on which it was the usual habit of the
master of the house and his wife to sleep <i>in their clothes,</i> lay the
fallen giant. So much as could be seen of his face was a mass of hideous
bruises, and one of his hands, which lay on the bed, was in splints; the chief
injury, however, was to his back, and from this he could never expect to
recover. By his side sat his little wife, who had on the previous day urged the
thrashing of the Hottentot. She glared fiercely at Jeremy, but said nothing. On
catching sight of his victor, the giant turned his face to the wall, and asked
what he wanted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have come,&rdquo; said Jeremy, Mr. Alston interpreting for him,
&ldquo;to say that I am sorry that you are injured so much; that I wanted to
beat you, but had no idea that I should hurt you so. I know that the trick of
throwing a man as I threw you is very dangerous, and I only used it as a last
resource, and because you would have killed me if I had not.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The Boer muttered something in reply about its being very bitter to be beaten
by such a little man.
</p>

<p>
It was evident to Ernest that the man&rsquo;s pride was utterly broken. He had
believed himself the strongest man, white or black, in Africa, and now an
English lad had thrown him over his shoulder like a plaything.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy next said that he hoped that he bore no malice, and would shake hands.
</p>

<p>
The giant hesitated a little, and then stretched out his uninjured hand, which
Jeremy took.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Englishman,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are a wonderful man, and you will
grow stronger yet. You have made a baby of me for life, and turned my heart to
a baby&rsquo;s too. Perhaps one day some man will do the same for you. Till
then you can never know what I feel. They will give you the Hottentot outside.
No, you must take him; you won him in fair fight. He is a good driver, though
he is so small. Now go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The sight was a painful one, and they were not sorry to get away from it.
Outside they found one of the young Boers waiting with the Hottentot boy, whom
he insisted on handing over to Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
Any scruples the latter had about accepting him were overcome by the look of
intense satisfaction on the features of the poor wretch himself when he learnt
that he was to be handed over.
</p>

<p>
His name was &ldquo;Aasv&ouml;gel&rdquo; (vulture), and he made Jeremy an
excellent and most faithful servant.

<h2><a name="chap26"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/>
A WAY OF ESCAPE</h2>

<p>
When Mr. Alston, Jeremy, and Ernest emerged from the back street in which was
the house they had visited into one of the principal thoroughfares of Pretoria,
they came upon a curious sight. In the middle of the street stood, or rather
danced, a wiry Zulu, dressed in an old military greatcoat and the ordinary
native &ldquo;moocha,&rdquo; or scanty kilt, and having a red worsted comforter
tied round one arm. He was shouting out something at the top of his voice, and
surrounded by a crowd of other natives, who at intervals expressed their
approval of what he was saying in deep guttural exclamations.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that lunatic after?&rdquo; asked Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston listened for a minute, and answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know the man well. His name is Goza. He is the fleetest runner in
Natal, and can go as fast as a horse; indeed, there are few horses that he
cannot tire out. By profession he is a &lsquo;praiser.&rsquo; He is now singing
the praises of the Special Commissioner&mdash;&lsquo;bongering&rsquo; they call
it. This is what he is saying:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Listen to the foot of the great elephant Somptseu (Sir T.
Shepstone). Feel how the earth shakes beneath the tread of the white
t&rsquo;Chaka,* father of the Zulus, foremost among the great white people. Ou!
he is coming; ou! he is here. See how the faces of the &ldquo;Amaboona&rdquo;
(the Boers) turn pale before him. He will eat them up; he will swallow them,
the huge vulture, who sits still till the ox is dead, who fights the fight of
&ldquo;sit down.&rdquo; Oh! he is great, the lion; where he turns his eye the
people melt away, their hearts turn to fat. Where is there one like Somptseu,
the man who is not afraid of Death; who looks at Death and it runs from him;
who has the tongue of honey; who reigns like the first star at night; who is
beloved and honoured of the great white mother, the Queen; who loves his
children, the Amazulu, and shelters them under his wide wing; who lifted
Cetywayo out of the dirt, and can put him back in the dirt again? Abase
yourselves, you low people, doctor yourself with medicine, lest his fierce eyes
should burn you up. O, hark! he comes, the father of kings, the Chaka; O! be
still; O! be silent; O! shake in your knees. He is here, the elephant, the
lion, the fierce one, the patient one, the strong one! See he deigns to talk to
little children; he teaches them wisdom; he gives light like the sun&mdash;he
is the sun&mdash;he is t&rsquo;Somptseu.&rsquo;&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
At this juncture a quiet-looking, oldish gentleman, entirely unlike either an
elephant, a lion, or a vulture, of medium height, with gray whiskers, a black
coat, and a neat black tie fastened in a bow, came round the corner, leading a
little girl by the hand. As he came the praiser lifted up his right hand, and
in the most stentorian tones gave the royal salute, &ldquo;Bayte,&rdquo; which
was re-echoed by all the other natives.
</p>

<p>
The oldish gentleman, who was none other than the Special Commissioner himself,
turned upon his extoller with a look of intense annoyance, and addressed him
very sharply in Zulu.

<p>
&ldquo;Be still,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Why do you always annoy me with your
noise? Be still, I say, you loud-tongued dog, or I will send you back to Natal.
My head aches with your empty words.&rdquo;

&ldquo;O, elephant! I am silent as the dead: Bayte. O Somptseu! I am quiet:
&lsquo;Bayte.&rsquo;&ldquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go! Begone!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
With a final shout of Bayte the Zulu turned and fled down the street with the
swiftness of the wind, shouting praises as he went.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, sir?&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, advancing. &ldquo;I was just
coming up to call upon you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Alston, I am delighted to see you. I heard that you were gone on a
hunting trip. Given up work and taken to hunting, eh? Well, I should like to do
the same. If I could have found you when I came up here, I should have been
tempted to ask you to come with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this point Mr. Alston introduced Ernest and Jeremy. The Special Commissioner
shook hands with them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard of you,&rdquo; he said to Jeremy; &ldquo;but I must ask you
not to fight any more giants here just at present; the tension between Boer and
Englishman is too great to allow of its being stretched any more. Do you know,
you nearly provoked an outbreak last night with your fighting? I trust that you
will not do it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke rather severely, and Jeremy coloured. Presently, however, he made
amends by asking them all to dinner.
</p>

<p>
On the following morning Ernest sent off his letter to Eva. He also wrote to
his uncle and to Dorothy, explaining his long silence as best he could. The
latter, too, he for the first time took into his confidence about Eva. At a
distance he no longer felt the same shyness in speaking to her about another
woman that had always overpowered him when he was by her side.
</p>

<p>
Now that he had been away from England for a year or so, many things connected
with his home life had grown rather faint amid the daily change and activity of
his new life. The rush of fresh impressions had to a great extent overlaid the
old ones, and Dorothy and Mr. Cardus and all the old Kesterwick existence and
surroundings seemed faint and far away. They were indeed rapidly assuming that
unreality which in time the wanderer finds gather round his old associations.
He feels that they know him no more; very likely he imagines that they have
forgotten him, and so they become like the shades of the dead. It is almost a
shock to such an one to come back and find, after an absence of many years,
that though he has been living a rapid vigorous life, and storing his time with
many acts, good, bad, and indifferent; though he thinks that he has changed so
completely, and developed greatly in one direction or another, yet the old
spots, the old familiar surroundings, and the old dear faces have changed
hardly one whit. They have been living their quiet English life, in which
sensation, incident, and excitement are things unfamiliar, and have varied not
at all.
</p>

<p>
Most people, as a matter of fact, change very little except in so far as they
are influenced by the cyclic variations of their life, the passage from youth
to maturity, and from maturity to age, and the attendant modes of thought and
action befitting each period. But even then the change is superficial rather
than real. What the child is, that the middle-aged person and the old man will
be also. The reason of this appears to be sufficiently obvious: the unchanging
personality that grows not old, the animating spiritual &ldquo;ego,&rdquo; is
there, and practically identical at all periods of life. The body, the brain,
and the subtler intellect may all vary according to the circumstances, mostly
physical, of personal existence; but the effect that the passage of a few
years, more or less active or stormy, can produce upon a principle so
indestructible, so immeasurably ancient, and the inheritor of so far-reaching a
destiny as we believe the individual human soul to be, surely must be small.
</p>

<p>
Already Ernest began to find it something of a labour to indite epistles to
people in England, and yet he had the pen of a ready writer. The links that
bound them together were fast breaking loose. Eva, and Eva alone, remained
clear and real to the vision of his mind. She was always with him; and to her,
at any period of his life, he never found difficulty in writing. For, in truth,
their very natures were interwoven, and the <i>rapport</i> between them was not
produced merely by the pressure of external circumstances, or by the fact of
continual contact and mutual attraction arising from physical causes, such as
the natural leaning of youth to youth and beauty to beauty.
</p>

<p>
These causes, according to Ernest&rsquo;s creed, no doubt had to do with its
production, and perhaps were necessary to its mundane birth, as the battery is
necessary to the creation of the electric spark. Thus, had Eva been old,
instead of a young and lovely girl, the <i>rapport</i> would perhaps never have
come into being here. In short, they formed the cable along which the occult
communication could pass, but there their function ended. Having once
established that communication, and provided a means by which the fusion of
spirit could be effected, youth and beauty and the natural attraction of sex to
sex had done their part. The great dividing river that rolls so fast and wide
between our souls in their human shape had been safely passed, and the two
fortunate travellers had been allowed before their time to reap
advantages&mdash;the measureless advantage of real love, so rare on earth, and
at its best so stained by passion, which will only come to most of us, and then
perhaps imperfectly in a different world from this.
</p>

<p>
Yes, the bridge might now be broken down; it had served its purpose. Come age,
or loss of physical attraction, or separation and icy silence, or the change
called death itself, and the souls thus subtly blended can and will and do defy
them. For the real life is not here; here only is the blind beginning of
things, maybe the premature beginning.
</p>

<p>
And so Ernest posted his letters, and then, partly to employ his thoughts, and
partly because it was his nature to throw himself into whatever stream of life
was flowing past him, he set himself to master the state of political affairs
in the country in which he found himself.
</p>

<p>
This need not be entered into here, further than to say that it was such as
might with advantage have employed wiser heads than his, and indeed did employ
them. Suffice it to say that he contrived to make himself of considerable use
to the English party, both before and after the annexation of the Transvaal to
the dominions of the Crown. Among other things he went on several missions in
conjunction with Mr. Alston, with a view of ascertaining the real state of
feeling among the Boers. Also, together with Jeremy, he joined a volunteer
corps which was organised for the defence of Pretoria when it was still a
matter of doubt whether or not the contemplated annexation would or would not
result in an attack being made upon the town by the Boers. It was a most
exciting time, and once or twice Ernest and Jeremy had narrow escapes of being
murdered.
</p>

<p>
However, nothing worthy of note happened to them, and at last the long-expected
annexation came off successfully, to the intense joy of all the Englishmen in
the country, and to the great relief of the vast majority of the Boers.
</p>

<p>
Now, together with the proclamation by which the Transvaal was annexed to her
Majesty&rsquo;s dominions, was issued another that was to have a considerable
bearing upon Ernest&rsquo;s fortunes. This was none other than a promise of her
Majesty&rsquo;s gracious pardon to all such as had been resident in the
Transvaal for a period of six months previous to the date of annexation, being
former British subjects and offenders against the English criminal law, who
would register their name and offence within a given time. The object of this
proclamation was to give immunity from prosecution to many individuals formerly
deserters from the English army, and other people who had in some way
transgressed the laws, but were now occupying respectable positions in their
adopted country.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston read this proclamation attentively when it came out in a special
number of the <i>Gazette.</i> Then, after thinking for a while, he handed it to
Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have read this amnesty proclamation?&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; answered Ernest; &ldquo;what of it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What of it? Ah, the stupidity of youth! Go down, go down on your knees,
young man, and render thanks to the Power that inspired Lord Carnarvon with the
idea of annexing the Transvaal. Can&rsquo;t you very well see that it takes
your neck out of the halter? Off with you, and register your name and offence
with the secretary to Government, and you will be clear for ever from any
consequences that might ensue from the slight indiscretion of having shot your
own first cousin on British soil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove, Alston! you don&rsquo;t mean that!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean it? of course I do. The proclamation does not specify any
particular offence to which pardon is to be denied, and you have lived more
than six months on Transvaal territory. Off you go!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And Ernest went like an arrow.
</p>

</div><!--end chapter-->

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap27"></a>CHAPTER XI.<br/>
FOUND WANTING</h2>

<p>
Ernest reached the Government office and registered his name, and in due course
received &ldquo;her Majesty&rsquo;s gracious pardon and indemnity from and
against all actions, proceedings, and prosecutions at law, having arisen,
arising, or to arise, by whomsoever undertaken, &amp;c., conveyed through his
Excellency the Administrator of Our said territory of the Transvaal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
When this precious document was in his pocket, Ernest thought that he now for
the first time fully realised what must be the feelings of a slave unexpectedly
manumitted. Had it not been for this fortunate accident, the consequences of
that fatal duel must have continually overshadowed him. Had he returned to
England, he would have been liable at any period of his life to a prosecution
for murder. Indeed, the arm of the law is long, and he lived in continual
apprehension of an application for his extradition being made to the
authorities of whatever country he was in. But now all this was gone from him,
and he felt that he would not be afraid to have words with an attorney-general,
or shudder any more at the sight of a policeman.
</p>

<p>
His first idea on getting his pardon was to return straightway to England; but
that silent Fate which directs men&rsquo;s lives, driving them whither they
would not, and forcing their bare and bleeding feet to stumble along the stony
paths of its hidden purpose, came into his mind, and made him see that it would
be better to delay a while. In a few weeks Eva&rsquo;s answer would surely
reach him. If he were to go now, it was even possible that he might pass her in
mid-ocean, for in his heart he never doubted but that she would come.
</p>

<p>
And indeed the very next mail there came a letter from Dorothy, written in
answer to that which he had posted on the same day that he had written to Eva.
It was only a short letter&mdash;the last post that could catch the mail was
just going out, and his welcome letter had only just arrived; but she had
twenty minutes, and she would send one line. She told him how grateful they
were to hear that he was well and safe, and reproached him gently for not
writing. Then she thanked him for making her his confidante about Eva Ceswick.
She had guessed it long before, she said; and she thought they were both lucky
in each other, and hoped and prayed that when the time came they would be as
completely happy as it was possible for people to be. She had never spoken to
Eva about him; but she should no longer feel any diffidence in doing so now.
She should go and see her very soon, and plead his cause: not that it wanted
any pleading, however, she was sure of that. Eva looked sad now that he was
gone. There had been some talk a while back of Mr. Plowden, the new clergyman;
but she supposed that Eva had given him his quietus, as she heard no more of it
now; and so on, till &ldquo;the postman is at the door waiting for this
letter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Little did Ernest guess what it cost poor Dorothy to write her congratulations
and wishes of happiness. A man&mdash;the nobler animal, remember&mdash;could
hardly have done it; only the inferior woman would show such unselfishness.
</p>

<p>
This letter filled Ernest with a sure and certain hope. Eva, he clearly saw,
had not had time to write by that mail; by the next her answer would come. It
can be imagined that he waited for its advent with some anxiety.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston, Ernest, and Jeremy had taken a house in Pretoria, and for the past
month or two had been living in it very comfortably. It was a pleasant
one-storied house, with a verandah and a patch of flower-garden in front of it,
in which grew a large gardenia-bush covered with hundreds of sweet-scented
blooms, and many rose-trees, that in the divine climate of Pretoria flourish
like thistles in our own. Beyond the flowers was a patch of vines, covered at
this season of the year with enormous bunches of grapes, extending down to the
line of waving willow-trees, interspersed with clumps of bamboo that grew along
the edge of the sluit and kept the house private from the road. On the other
side of the narrow path which led to the gate was a bed of melons, now rapidly
coming to perfection. This garden was Ernest&rsquo;s especial pride and
occupation, and just then he was much troubled in his mind about the melons,
which were getting scorched by the bright rays of the sun. To obviate this he
had designed cunning frameworks of little willow twigs, which he stuck over the
melons and covered with dry grass&mdash;&ldquo;parasols&rdquo; he called them.
</p>

<p>
One morning&mdash;it was a particularly lovely morning&mdash;Ernest was
standing after breakfast on this path, smoking, and directing Mazooku as to the
erection of the &ldquo;parasols&rdquo; over his favourite melons. It was not a
job at all suited to the capacity of the great Zulu, whose assegai, stuck in
the ground behind him in the middle of a small bundle of knob-sticks, seemed a
tool ominously unlike those used by gardeners of other lands. However,
&ldquo;needs must when the devil drives,&rdquo; and there was the brawny fellow
on his knees, puffing and blowing, and trying to fix the tuft of grass to
Ernest&rsquo;s satisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mazooku, you lazy hound,&rdquo; said the latter, at last, &ldquo;if you
don&rsquo;t put that tuft right in two shakes, by the heaven you will never
reach, I&rsquo;ll break your head with your own kerrie!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ow, Inkoos,&rdquo; replied the Zulu, sulkily, again trying to prop up
the tuft, and muttering to himself meanwhile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you catch what that fellow of yours is saying?&rdquo; asked Mr.
Alston. &ldquo;He is saying that all Englishmen are mad, and that you are the
maddest of the mad. He considers that nobody who was not a lunatic would bother
his head with those &lsquo;weeds that stink&rsquo; (flowers), or these fruits
which, even if you succeed in growing them&mdash;and surely the things are
bewitched, or they would grow without &lsquo;hats&rsquo; (Ernest&rsquo;s
parasols)&mdash; must lie very cold on the stomach.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the particular &ldquo;hat&rdquo; which Mazooku was trying to
arrange fell down again, whereupon the Zulu&rsquo;s patience gave out, and,
cursing it for a witch in the most vigorous language, he emphasised his words
by bringing his fist straight down on the melon, smashing it to pieces.
Whereupon Ernest made for him, and he vanished swiftly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston stood by laughing at the scene, and awaited Ernest&rsquo;s return.
Presently he came strolling back, not having caught Mazooku. Indeed, it would
not have greatly mattered if he had; for, as that swarthy gentleman very well
knew, great indeed must be the provocation that could induce Ernest to touch a
native. It was a thing to which he had an almost unconquerable aversion, in the
same way that he objected to the word &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; as applied to a
people who, whatever their faults may be, are, as a rule, gentlemen in the
truest sense of the word.
</p>

<p>
As he came strolling down the path towards him, his face a little flushed with
the exertion, Mr. Alston thought to himself that Ernest was growing into a very
handsome fellow. The tall frame, narrow at the waist and broad at the
shoulders, the eloquent dark eyes, which so far surpass the loveliest gray or
blue, the silken hair, which curled over his head like that on a Grecian
statue, the curved lips, the quick intelligence and kindly smile that lit the
whole face&mdash;all these things helped to make his appearance not so much
handsome as charming, and to women captivating to a dangerous extent. His
dress, too&mdash;which consisted of riding-breeches, boots and spurs, a white
waistcoat and linen coat, with a very broad soft felt hat looped up at one
side, so as to throw the face into alternate light and shadow&mdash;helped the
general effect considerably. Altogether Ernest was a pretty fellow in those
days.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy was lounging on an easy-chair in the verandah, in company with the boy
Roger Alston, and intensely interested in watching a furious battle between two
lines of ants, black and red, who had their homes somewhere in the stonework.
For a long while the issue of the battle remained doubtful, victory inclining,
if anything, to the side of the thin red line, when suddenly, from the entrance
to the nest of the black ants, there emerged a battalion of giants&mdash;great
fellows, at least six times the size of the others&mdash;who fell upon the red
ants and routed them, taking many prisoners. Then followed the most curious
spectacle, namely, the deliberate execution of the captive red ants, by having
their heads bitten off by the great black soldiers. Jeremy and Roger knew what
was coming very well, for these battles were of frequent occurrence, and the
casualties among the red ants simply frightful. On this occasion they
determined to save the prisoners, which was effected by dipping a match in some
of the nicotine at the bottom of a pipe, and placing it in front of the black
giants. The ferocious insects would thereupon abandon their captives, and,
rushing at the strange intruder, hang on like bulldogs till the poison did its
work, and they dropped off senseless, to recover presently and stagger off
home, holding their legs to their antennas and exhibiting every other symptom
of frightful headache.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy was sitting on a chair, oiling the matches, and Roger, kneeling on the
pavement, was employed in beguiling the giants into biting them, when suddenly
they heard the sound of galloping horses and the rattle of wheels. The lad,
lowering his head still more, looked out towards the market-square through a
gap between the willow-stems.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurrah, Mr. Jones,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here comes the mail!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Next minute, amid loud blasts from the bugle, and enveloped in a cloud of dust,
the heavy cart, to the sides and seats of which the begrimed and worn-out
passengers were clinging like drowning men to straws, came rattling along as
fast as the six grays reserved for the last stage could gallop, and vanished
towards the post-office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There&rsquo;s the mail, Ernest,&rdquo; hallooed Jeremy; &ldquo;she will
bring the English letters.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest nodded, turned a little pale, and nervously knocked out his pipe. No
wonder: that mail-cart carried his destiny, and he knew it. Presently he walked
across the square to the post-office. The letters were not sorted, and he was
the first person there. Very soon one of his Excellency&rsquo;s staff came
riding down to get the Government House bag. It was the same gentleman with
whom he had sung &ldquo;Auld lang syne&rdquo; so enthusiastically on the day of
Jeremy&rsquo;s encounter with the giant, and had afterwards been carted home in
the wheelbarrow.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, Kershaw, here we are, &lsquo;primos inter omnes,&rsquo;
&lsquo;primos primi primores,&rsquo; which is it? Come, Kershaw, you are the
last from school&mdash;which is it? I don&rsquo;t believe, you know&mdash;ha!
ha! ha! What are you doing down here so soon? Does the &lsquo;expectant swain
await the postman&rsquo;s knock&rsquo;? Why, my dear fellow, you look pale; you
must be in love or thirsty. So am I&mdash;the latter, not the former. Love, I
do abjure thee. &lsquo;Quis separabit,&rsquo; who will have a split? I think
that the sun can&rsquo;t be far from the line. Shall we, my dear Kershaw,
<i>shall</i> we take an observation? Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, thank you, I never drink anything between meals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! my boy, a bad habit; give it up before it is too late. Break it off,
my dear Kershaw, and always wet your whistle in the strictest moderation, or
you will die young. What says the poet?&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;<i>He who drinks strong beer, and goes to bed mellow,<br/>
Lives as he ought to live, lives as he ought to live,<br/>
Lives as he ought to live, and dies a jolly good fellow.</i>&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p class="noindent">
Byron, I think, is it not? Ha! ha! ha!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then some others came up, and, somewhat to Ernest&rsquo;s relief, his
friend turned the light of his kindly countenance to shine elsewhere, and left
him to his thoughts.
</p>

<p>
At last the little shutter of the post-office was thrown up, and Ernest got his
own letters, together with those belonging to Mr. Alston and Jeremy. He turned
into the shade of a neighbouring verandah, and rapidly sorted the pile. There
was no letter in Eva&rsquo;s handwriting. But there was one in that of her
sister Florence. Ernest knew the writing well; there was no mistaking its
peculiar upright, powerful-looking characters. This he opened hurriedly.
Enclosed in the letter was a note, which was in the writing he had expected to
see. He rapidly unfolded it, and, as he did so, a flash of fear passed through
his brain.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did she write in this way?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The note could not have been a long one, for in another minute it was lying on
the ground, and Ernest, pale-faced and with catching breath, was clinging to
the verandah post with both hands to save himself from falling. In a few
seconds he recovered, and, picking up the note, walked quickly across the
square towards his house. Halfway across he was overtaken by his friend on the
Staff cantering gaily along on a particularly wooden-looking pony, from the
sides of which his legs projected widely, and waving in one hand the Colonial
Office bag addressed to the administrator of the Government.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo, my abstemious friend!&rdquo; he hallooed, as he pulled up the
wooden pony with a jerk that sent each of its stiff legs sprawling in a
different direction. &ldquo;Was patience rewarded? Is Chloe over the water
kind? If not, take my advice, and don&rsquo;t trouble your head about her.
<i>Quant on n&rsquo;a pas ce qu&rsquo;on aime,</i> the wise man <i>aimes ce
qu&rsquo;il a.</i> Kershaw, I have conceived a great affection for you, and I
will let you into a secret. Come with me this afternoon, and I will introduce
you to two charming specimens of indigenous beauty. Like roses they bloom upon
the veldt, and waste their sweetness on the desert air. &lsquo;Mater pulchra,
puella pulcherrima,&rsquo; as Virgil says. I, as befits my years, will attach
myself to the mater, for you sweet youth shall be reserved the puella. Ha! ha!
ha! &ldquo;And he brought the despatch-bag down with a sounding whack between
the ears of the wooden pony, with the result that he was nearly sent flying
into the sluit, being landed by a sudden plunge well on to the animal&rsquo;s
crupper.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Woho, Bucephalus, woho! or your mealies shall be cut off.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then he for the first time caught sight of the face of his companion, who
was plodding along in silence by his side.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo! what&rsquo;s up, Kershaw?&rdquo; he said, in an altered tone;
&ldquo;you don&rsquo;t look well. Nothing wrong, I hope?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, nothing,&rdquo; answered Ernest, quietly; &ldquo;that is, I
have got some bad news, that is all. Nothing to speak of, nothing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, I am so sorry, and I have been troubling you with my
nonsense. Forgive me. There, you wish to be alone. Good-bye.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A few seconds later, Mr. Alston and Jeremy, from their point of vantage on the
verandah, saw Ernest coming with swift strides up the garden-path. His face was
drawn with pain, and there was a fleck of blood upon his lip. He passed them
without a word, and, entering the house, slammed the door of his own room. Mr.
Alston and Jeremy looked at one another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What&rsquo;s up?&rdquo; said the laconic Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston thought a while before he answered, as was his fashion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Something gone wrong with &lsquo;the ideal,&rsquo; I should say,&rdquo;
he said at length; &ldquo;that is the way of ideals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we go and see?&rdquo; said Jeremy, uneasily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, give him a minute or two to pull himself together. Lots of time for
consolation afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ernest, having got into his room, sat down upon the bed, and again
read the note which was enclosed in Florence&rsquo;s letter. Then he folded it
up and put it down, slowly and methodically. Next he opened the other letter,
which he had not yet looked at, and read that too. After he had done it he
threw himself face downwards on the pillow, and thought a while. Presently he
arose, and, going to the other side of the room, took down a revolver case
which hung to a nail, and drew out a revolver, which was loaded. Returning, he
again sat down upon the bed, and cocked it. So he remained for a minute or two,
and then slowly lifted the pistol towards his head. At that moment he heard
footsteps approaching, and, with a quick movement, threw the weapon under the
bed. As he did so Mr. Alston and Jeremy entered.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus09"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig09.jpg" width="404" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;He slowly lifted the pistol towards his head.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Any letters, Ernest?&rdquo; asked the former.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Letters! O yes, I beg your pardon; here they are;&rdquo; and he took a
packet from the pocket of his white coat, and handed them to him.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston took them, looking all the while fixedly at Ernest, who avoided his
glance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, my boy?&rdquo; he said kindly, at last;
&ldquo;nothing wrong, I hope?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked at him blankly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it, old chap?&rdquo; said Jeremy, seating himself on the bed
beside him, and laying his hand on his arm.
</p>

<p>
Then Ernest broke out into a paroxysm of grief painful to behold. Fortunately
for all concerned, it was brief. Had it lasted much longer, something must have
given way. Suddenly his mood changed, and he grew hard and bitter.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, my dear fellows, nothing,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;that is, only
the sequel to a pretty little idyl. You may remember a letter I wrote&mdash;to
a woman&mdash;some months back. There, you both of you know the story. Now you
shall hear the answer, or, to be more correct, the answers.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&mdash;woman has a sister. Both she and her sister have written to
me. My&mdash;her sister&rsquo;s letter is the longest. We will take it first. I
think that we may skip the first page, there is nothing particular in it, and I
do not wish to&mdash;waste your time. Now listen:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;By the way, I have a piece of news for you which will interest
you, and which you will, I am sure, be glad to hear; for, of course, you will
have by this time got over any little <i>tendresse</i> you may have had in that
direction. Eva&rsquo; (that is the woman to whom I wrote, and to whom I thought
I was engaged) &lsquo;is going to be married to a Mr. Plowden, a gentleman who
has been acting as <i>locum tenens</i> for Mr. Halford.&rsquo;&rdquo; Here Jeremy
sprang up, and swore a great oath. Ernest motioned him down, and went on:
&ldquo;&lsquo;I say I am certain that you will be glad to hear this, because
the match is in every respect a satisfactory one, and will, I am sure, bring
dear Eva happiness. Mr. Plowden is well off, and, of course, a
clergyman&mdash;two great guarantees for the success of their matrimonial
venture. Eva tells me that she had a letter from you last mail&rsquo; (the
letter I read you, gentlemen), &lsquo;and asks me to thank you for it. If she
can find time, she will send you a line shortly; but, as you will understand,
she has her hands very full just at present. The wedding is to take place at
Kesterwick Church on the 17th of May&rsquo; (that is to-morrow, gentlemen),
&lsquo;and, if this letter reaches you in time, I am sure you will think of us
all on that day. It will be very quiet owing to our dear aunt&rsquo;s death
being still so comparatively recent. Indeed, the engagement has, in obedience
to Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s wishes&mdash;for he is very retiring&mdash;been kept
quite secret, and you are absolutely the first person to whom it has been
announced. I hope that you will feel duly flattered, sir. We are very busy
about the trousseau, and just now the burning question is, of what colour the
dress in which Eva is to go away in after the wedding shall be. Eva and I are
all for gray. Mr. Plowden is for olive-green, and, as is natural under the
circumstances, I expect that he will carry the day. They are together in the
drawing-room settling it now. You always admired Eva (rather warmly once; do
you remember how cut up you both were when you went away? Alas for the
fickleness of human nature!); you should see her now. Her happiness makes her
look lovely&mdash;but I hear her calling me. No doubt they have settled the
momentous question. Good-bye. I am not clever at writing, but I hope that my
news will make up for my want of skill.&mdash;Always yours,
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;&lsquo;Florence Ceswick.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
Now for the enclosure,&rdquo; said Ernest:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Dear Ernest,&mdash;I got your letter. Florence will tell you what
there is to tell. I am going to be married. Think what you will of me; I cannot
help myself. Believe me, this has cost me great suffering; but my duty seems
clear. I hope that you will forget me, Ernest, as henceforth it will be my duty
to forget you. Good-bye, my dear Ernest; O, good-bye!&rsquo;&rdquo; &emsp;
&emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp; &emsp;
&lsquo;E.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="p2">
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Humph!&rdquo; murmured Mr. Alston beneath his breath. &ldquo;As I
thought&mdash;clay, and damned bad clay, too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Slowly Ernest tore the letter into small fragments, threw them down, and
stamped upon them with his foot as though they were a living thing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish that I had shaken the life out of that devil of a parson!&rdquo;
groaned Jeremy, who was in his way as much affected by the news as his friend.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse you!&rdquo; said Ernest, turning on him fiercely; &ldquo;why
didn&rsquo;t you stop where you were and look after her, instead of coming
humbugging after me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy only groaned humbly by way of answer. Mr. Alston, as was his way when
perplexed, filled his pipe and lit it. Ernest paced swiftly up and down the
little room, the white walls of which he had decorated with pictures cut from
illustrated papers, Christmas cards, and photographs. Over the head of the bed
was a photograph of Eva herself, which he had framed in some beautiful native
wood. He reached it down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;that is the lady herself. Handsome,
isn&rsquo;t she, and pleasant to look on? Who would have thought that she was
such a devil? Tells me to forget her, and talks about &lsquo;her duty&rsquo;!
Women love a little joke!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hurled the photograph on to the floor, and treated it as he had treated the
letter, grinding it to pieces with his heel.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They say,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;that a man&rsquo;s curses are
sometimes heard wherever it is they arrange these pleasant surprises for us.
Now, you fellows bear witness to what I say, and watch that woman&rsquo;s life.
I curse her before God and man! May she lay down her head in sorrow night by
night and year by year! May her&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Stop, Ernest,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, with a shrug; &ldquo;you might be
taken at your word, and you wouldn&rsquo;t like that, you know. Besides, it is
cowardly to go on cursing at a woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest paused, standing for a moment with his clenched fist still raised above
his head, his pale lips quivering with intense excitement, and his dark eyes
flashing and blazing like stars.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are right,&rdquo; he said, dropping his fist on to the table.
&ldquo;It is with the man that I have to deal.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What man?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This Plowden. I fear that I shall disturb his honeymoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that I am going to kill him, or he is going to kill me; it does
not matter which.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what quarrel have you with the man? Of course he looked after
himself. You could not expect him to consider your interests, could you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he had cut me out fairly, I should not have a word to say. Every man
for himself in this pleasant world. But, mark my words, this parson and
Florence have forced Eva into this unholy business, and I will have his life in
payment. If you don&rsquo;t believe me, ask Jeremy. He saw something of the
game before he left.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Kershaw, the man&rsquo;s a parson. He will take shelter
behind his cloth; he won&rsquo;t fight. What shall you do then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall shoot him,&rdquo; was the cool reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, you are mad; it won&rsquo;t do. You shall not go, and that is
all about it. You shall not ruin yourself over this woman, who is not fit to
black an honest man&rsquo;s shoes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall not! shall not! Alston, you use strong language. Who will prevent
me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I will prevent you,&rdquo; he answered, sternly. &ldquo;I am your
superior officer, and the corps you belong to is not disbanded. If you try to
leave this place you shall be arrested as a deserter. Now don&rsquo;t be a
fool, lad; you have killed one man, and got out of the mess. If you kill
another you will not get out of it. Besides, what will the satisfaction be? If
you want revenge, be patient. It will come. I have seen something of life; at
least, I am old enough to be your father, and I know that you think me a cynic
because I laugh at your &lsquo;high-falutin&rsquo; about women. How justly I
warned you, you see now. But, cynic or not, I believe in the God above us, and
I believe, too, that there is a rough justice in this world. It is in the world
principally that people expiate the sins of the world; and if this marriage is
such a wicked thing as you think, it will bring its own trouble with it,
without any help from you. Time will avenge you. Everything comes to him who
can wait.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest&rsquo;s eyes glittered coldly as he answered: &ldquo;I cannot wait. I am
a ruined man already; all my life is laid waste. I wish to die, but I wish to
kill him before I die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So sure as my name is Alston you shall not go!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So sure as my name is Kershaw I <i>will</i> go!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
For a moment the two men faced one another; it would have been hard to say
which looked the most determined. Then Mr. Alston turned and left the room and
the house. On the verandah he paused and considered for a moment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The boy means business,&rdquo; he thought to himself. &ldquo;He will try
and bolt. How can I stop him? Ah, I have it!&rdquo; And he set off briskly
towards Government House, saying aloud as he went, &ldquo;I love that lad too
well to let him destroy himself over a jilt.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap28"></a>CHAPTER XII.<br/>
ERNEST RUNS AWAY</h2>

<p>
When Alston left the room, Ernest sat down on the bed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am not going to be domineered over by Alston,&rdquo; he said
excitedly; &ldquo;he presumes upon his friendship.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy came and sat beside him, and took hold of his arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, don&rsquo;t talk like that. You know he means kindly by
you. You are not yourself just yet. By-and-by you will see things in a
different light.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not myself, indeed! Would you be yourself, I wonder, if you knew that
the woman who had pinned all your soul to her bosom, as though it were a
ribbon, was going to marry another man to-morrow?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Old fellow, you forget, though I can&rsquo;t talk of it in as pretty
words as you can, I loved her too. I could bear to give her up to you,
especially as she didn&rsquo;t care a brass farthing about me; but when I think
about this other fellow, with his cold gray eye and that mark on his confounded
forehead&mdash;ah, Ernest, it makes me sick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And they sat on the bed together and groaned in chorus, looking, to tell the
truth, rather absurd.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I tell you what it is, Jeremy,&rdquo; said Ernest, when he had finished
groaning at the vision of his successful rival as painted by Jeremy; &ldquo;you
are a good fellow, and I am a selfish beast. Here have I been kicking up all
this devil&rsquo;s delight, and you haven&rsquo;t said a word. You are a more
decent chap than I am, Jeremy, by a long chalk. And I daresay you are as fond
of her as I am. No, I don&rsquo;t think you can be that, though.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, there is no parallel between our cases. I never expected
to marry her. You did, and had every right to do so. Besides, we are
differently made. You feel things three times as much as I do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t think that I shall ever feel anything again,&rdquo; he
said. &ldquo;My capacities for suffering will be pretty nearly used up. O, what
a sublime fool is the man who gives all his life and heart to one woman! No man
would have done it; but what could you expect of a couple of boys like we were?
That is why women like boys: it is so easy to take them in&mdash;like puppies
going to be drowned, in love and faith they lick the hand that will destroy
them. It must be amusing&mdash;to the destroyers. By Jove, Alston was right
about his ideals! Do you know, I am beginning to see all these things in quite
a different light. I used to believe in women, Jeremy&mdash;actually I used to
believe in them. I thought they were better than we are,&rdquo; and he laughed
hysterically. &ldquo;Well, we buy our experience; I sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t make
the mistake again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, Ernest, don&rsquo;t go on talking like that. You have got a
blow as bad as death, and the only thing to do is to meet it as you would meet
death&mdash;in silence. You will not go after that fellow, will you? It will
only make things worse, you see. You won&rsquo;t have time to kill him before
he marries her, and it really would not be worth while getting hanged about it
when the mischief is done. There is literally nothing to be done except grin
and bear it. We won&rsquo;t go back to England at all, but right up to the
Zambesi, and hunt elephants; and as things have turned out, if you should get
knocked on the head, why, you won&rsquo;t so much mind it, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest made no answer to this consolatory address, and Jeremy left him alone,
thinking that he had convinced him. But the Ernest of midday was a very
different man from the Ernest of the morning, directing the erection of
&ldquo;parasols&rdquo; over melons. The cruel news that the mail had brought
him, and which from force of association caused him for years afterwards to
hate the sight of a letter, had, figuratively speaking, destroyed him. He could
never recover from it, though he would certainly survive it. Sharp indeed must
be the grief which kills. But all the bloom and beauty had gone from his life;
the gentle faith which he had placed in women was gone (for so narrowminded are
we all, that we cannot help judging a class by our salient experiences of
individuals), and, from that day forwards, for many years, he was handed over
to a long-drawn-out pain, which never quite ceased, though it frequently
culminated in paroxysms, and to which death itself would have been almost
preferable.
</p>

<p>
But as yet he did not realise all these things; what he did realise was an
intense and savage thirst for revenge&mdash;so intense, indeed, that he felt as
though he must put himself in a way to gratify it, or his brain would go.
To-morrow, he thought, was to see the final act of his betrayal. To-day was the
eve of her marriage, and he as powerless to avert it as a child. O, great God!
And yet through it all he knew she loved him.
</p>

<p>
Ernest, like many other pleasant, kindly-tempered men, if once stung into
action by the sense of overpowering wrong, was extremely dangerous. Ill indeed
would it have fared with Mr. Plowden if he could have come across him at that
moment. And he honestly meant that it should fare ill with that reverend
gentleman. So much did he mean it, that before he left his room he wrote his
resignation of membership of the volunteer corps to which he belonged, and took
it up to the Government office. Then, remembering that the Potchefstroom
post-cart left Pretoria at dawn on the following morning, he made his way to
the office, and ascertained that there were no passengers booked to leave by
it. But he did not take a place; he was too clever to do that. Leaving the
office, he went to the bank, and drew one hundred and fifty pounds in gold.
Then he went home again. Here he found a Kafir messenger, dressed in the
Government white uniform, waiting for him with an official letter.
</p>

<p>
The letter acknowledged receipt of his resignation, but &ldquo;regretted that,
in the present unsettled state of affairs, his Excellency was, in the interest
of the public service, unable to dispense with his services.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest dismissed the messenger, and tore the letter across. If the Government
could not dispense with him, he would dispense with the Government. His aim was
to go to Potchefstroom, and thence to the Diamond Fields. Once there, he could
take the post-cart to Cape Town, where he would meet the English mail steamer,
and in one month from the present date be once more in England.
</p>

<p>
That evening he dined with Mr. Alston, Jeremy, and Roger as usual, and no
allusion was made to the events of the morning. About eleven o&rsquo;clock he
went to bed, but not to sleep. The post-cart left at four. At three he rose
very quietly, and put a few things into a leather saddle-bag, extracted his
revolver from under the bed where he had thrown it when, in the first burst of
his agony, he had been interrupted in his contemplated act of self destruction,
and buckled it round his waist. Then he slipped out through the window of his
room, crept stealthily down the garden-path, and struck out for the
Potchefstroom road. But, silently and secretly as he went, there went behind
him one more silent and secret than he&mdash;one to whose race, through long
generations of tracking foes and wild beasts, silence and secrecy had become an
instinct. It was the Hottentot boy, Aasv&ouml;gel.
</p>

<p>
The Hottentot followed him in the dim light, never more than fifty paces behind
him, sometimes not more than ten, and yet totally invisible. Now he was behind
a bush or a tuft of rank grass; now he was running down a ditch; and now again
creeping over the open on his belly like a two-legged snake. As soon as Ernest
got out of the town, and began to loiter along the Potchefstroom road, the
Hottentot halted, uttering to himself a guttural expression of satisfaction.
Then, watching his opportunity, he turned and ran swiftly back to Pretoria. In
ten minutes he was at Ernest&rsquo;s house.
</p>

<p>
In front of the door were five horses, three with white riders, two being held
by Kafirs. On the verandah, as usual smoking, was Mr. Alston, and with him
Jeremy, the latter armed and spurred.
</p>

<p>
The Hottentot made his report and vanished.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston turned and addressed Jeremy in the tone of one giving an order.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; he said at last, handing him a paper; and Jeremy went,
and, mounting one of the led horses, a powerful cream-coloured animal with a
snow-white mane and tail, galloped off into the twilight, followed by the three
white men.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ernest walked quietly along the road. Once he paused, thinking that
he heard the sound of galloping horses, half a mile or so to the left. It
passed, and he went on again. Presently the mist began to lift, and the
glorious sun came up; then came a rumble of wheels running along the silent
road, and the post-cart with six fresh horses was upon him. He halted, and held
up his hand to the native driver. The man knew him, and stopped the team at
once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am going with you to Potchefstroom, Apollo,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, sar; plenty of room inside, sar. No passenger this trip, sar,
and damn good job too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest got up, and off they went. He was safe now. There was no telegraph to
Potchefstroom, and nothing could catch the post-cart if it had an hour&rsquo;s
start.
</p>

<p>
A mile farther on there was a hill, up which the unlovely Apollo walked his
horses. At the top of the hill was a clump of mimosa-bush, out of which, to the
intense astonishment of both Ernest and Apollo, there emerged four mounted men
with a led horse. One of these men was Jeremy; it was impossible to mistake his
powerful form, sitting on his horse with the grip of a centaur.
</p>

<p>
They rode up to the post-cart in silence. Jeremy motioned to Apollo to pull up.
He obeyed, and one of the men dismounted and seized the horse&rsquo;s head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tricked, by Heaven!&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You must come back with me, Ernest,&rdquo; said Jeremy quietly. &ldquo;I
have a warrant for your arrest as a deserter, signed by the Governor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And if I refuse?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then my orders are to take you back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest drew his revolver.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;This is a trick,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I shall not go back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I must take you,&rdquo; was the reply; and Jeremy coolly
dismounted.
</p>

<p>
Ernest&rsquo;s eyes flashed dangerously, and he lifted the pistol.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, you can shoot me if you like; but if you do, the others will take
you;&rdquo; and he continued to walk towards him.
</p>

<p>
Ernest cocked his revolver and pointed it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;At your peril!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Jeremy, and he walked up to the cart.
</p>

<p>
Ernest dropped his weapon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is mean of you, Jeremy,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know I can&rsquo;t
fire at you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course you can&rsquo;t, old fellow. Come, skip out of that! you are
keeping the mail. I have a horse ready for you, a slow one; you won&rsquo;t be
able to run away on him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest obeyed, feeling rather small, and in half an hour was back at his own
house.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston was waiting for him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-morning, Ernest,&rdquo; he said, cheerfully. &ldquo;Went out
driving and come back riding, eh?&rdquo; Ernest looked at him, and his brown
cheek flushed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have played me a dirty trick,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, my boy,&rdquo; answered Mr. Alston, sternly, &ldquo;I am slow
at making a friend; but when once I take his hand I hold it till one of the two
grows cold. I should have been no true friend to you if I had let you go on
this fool&rsquo;s errand, this wicked errand. Will you give me your word that
you will not attempt to escape, or must I put you under arrest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I give you my word,&rdquo; answered Ernest, humbled; &ldquo;and I ask
your forgiveness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that, for the first time in his life, Ernest tried to run away.
</p>

<p>
That morning Jeremy, missing Ernest, went into his room to see what he was
doing. The room was shuttered to keep out the glare of the sun: but when he got
used to the light he discovered Ernest sitting at the table, and staring
straight before him with a wild look in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come in, old fellow, come in,&rdquo; he called out, with bitter
jocularity, &ldquo;and assist at this happy ceremony. Rather dark, isn&rsquo;t
it? but lovers like the dark. Look!&rdquo; he went on, pointing to his watch,
which lay upon the table before him, &ldquo;by English time it is now about
twenty minutes past eleven. They are being married now, Jeremy, my boy, I can
feel it. By Heaven, I have only to shut my eyes and I can <i>see</i> it!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, Ernest,&rdquo; said Jeremy, &ldquo;don&rsquo;t go on like
that. You are not yourself, man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed, and answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am sure I wish I wasn&rsquo;t, I tell you I can see it all. I can see
Kesterwick Church full of people, and before the altar, in her white dress, is
Eva; but her face is whiter than her dress, Jeremy, and her eyes are very much
afraid. And there is Florence, with her dark smile, and your friend Mr.
Plowden, too, with his cold eyes and the cross upon his forehead. Oh, I assure
you, I can see them all. It is a pretty wedding, very. There, it is over now,
and I think I will go away before the kissing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, hang it all, Ernest, wake up!&rdquo; said Jeremy, shaking him by the
shoulder. &ldquo;You will drive yourself mad if you give your imagination so
much rein.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wake up, my boy! I feel more inclined to sleep. Have some grog.
Won&rsquo;t you? Well, I will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He rose and went to the mantelpiece, on which stood a square bottle of hollands
and a tumbler. Rapidly filling the tumbler with raw spirit, he drank it as fast
as the contractions of his throat would allow. He filled it again, and drank
that too. Then he fell insensible upon the bed.
</p>

<p>
It was a strange scene, and in some ways a coarse one, but yet not without a
pathos of its own.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston, three weeks later, &ldquo;you are strong
enough to travel now; what do you say to six months or a year among the
elephants? The oxen are in first-rate condition, and we ought to get to our
ground in six or seven weeks.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest, who was lying back in a low cane-chair, looking very thin and pale,
thought for a moment before he answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, I&rsquo;m your man; only let&rsquo;s get off soon. I am tired
of this place, and want something to think about.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have given up the idea of returning to England?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, quite.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what do you say, Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where Ernest goes, there will I go also. Besides, to shoot an elephant
is the one ambition of my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! then we will consider that settled. We shall want to pick up
another eight-bore; but I know of one a fellow wants to sell, a beauty, by
Riley. I will begin to make arrangements at once.&rdquo;
</p>

MR. PLOWDEN ASSERTS HIS RIGHTS</h2>

<p>
When last we saw Eva she had just become privately engaged to the Reverend
James Plowden. But the marriage was not to take place till the following
spring, and the following spring was a long way off. Vaguely she hoped
something might occur to prevent it, forgetting that, as a rule, in real life
it is only happy things which accidents occur to prevent. Rare, indeed, is it
that the Plowdens of this world are prevented from marrying the Evas; Fate has
sufficient to do in thwarting the Ernests. And, meanwhile, her position was not
altogether unendurable, for she had made a bargain with her lover that the
usual amenities of courtship were to be dispensed with. There were to be no
embracings or other tender passages; she was not even to be forced to call him
James. &ldquo;James!&rdquo; how she detested the name! Thus did the wretched
girl try to put off the evil day, much as the ostrich is supposed to hide her
head in a bush and indulge in dreams of fancied security. Mr. Plowden did not
object; he was too wary a hunter to do so. While his stately prey was there
with her head in the thickest of the bush he was sure of her. She would never
wake from her foolish dreams till the ripe moment came to deliver the fatal
blow, and all would be over. But if, on the contrary, he startled her now, she
might take flight more swiftly than he could follow, and leave him alone in the
desert.
</p>

<p>
So when Eva made her little stipulations he acquiesced in them, after only just
so much hesitation as he thought would seem lover-like. &ldquo;Life,
Eva,&rdquo; he said, sententiously, &ldquo;is a compromise. I yield to your
wishes.&rdquo; But in his heart he thought that a time would come when she
would have to yield to his, and his cold eye gleamed. Eva saw the gleam, and
shuddered prophetically.
</p>

<p>
The Reverend Mr. Plowden did not suffer much distress at the coldness with
which he was treated. He knew that his day would come, and was content to wait
for it like a wise man. He was not in love with Eva. A nature like his is
scarcely capable of any such feeling as that, for instance, which Eva and
Ernest bore to each other. True love, crowned with immortality, veils his
shining face from such men as Mr. Plowden. He was fascinated by her beauty,
that was all. But his cunning was of a superior order, and he was quite content
to wait. So he contrived to extract a letter from Eva, in which she talked of
&ldquo;our engagement,&rdquo; and alluded to &ldquo;our forthcoming
marriage,&rdquo; and waited.
</p>

<p>
And thus the time went on all too quickly for Eva. She was quietly miserable,
but she was not acutely unhappy. That was yet to come, with other evil things.
Christmas came and went, the spring came too, and with the daffodils and
violets came Ernest&rsquo;s letter.
</p>

<p>
Eva was down the first one morning, and was engaged in making the tea in the
Cottage dining-room, when that modern minister to the decrees of Fate, the
postman, brought the letter. She recognised the writing in a moment, and the
tea-caddy fell with a crash on to the floor. Seizing the sealed letter, she
tore it open and read it swiftly. O, what a wave of love surged up in her heart
as she read! Pressing the senseless paper to her lips, she kissed it again and
again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest!&rdquo; she murmured; &ldquo;O my love, my darling!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then Florence came down, looking cool and composed, and giving that idea
of quiet strength which is the natural attribute of some women.
</p>

<p>
Eva pushed the letter into her bosom.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, Eva?&rdquo; said Florence, quietly, noting her
flushed face, &ldquo;and why have you upset the tea?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Matter!&rdquo; she answered, laughing happily&mdash;she had not laughed
so for months; &ldquo;O, nothing&mdash;I have heard from Ernest, that is
all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; answered her sister, with a troubled smile on her dark
face; &ldquo;and what has our runaway to say for himself?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Say! O, he has a great deal to say, and I have something to say too. I
am going to marry him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! And Mr. Plowden?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva turned pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. Plowden! I have done with Mr. Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed!&rdquo; said Florence, again; &ldquo;really this is quite
romantic. But please pick up that tea. Whoever you marry, let us have some
breakfast in the meanwhile. Excuse me for one moment, I have forgotten my
handkerchief.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva did as she was bid, and made the tea after a fashion.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Florence went to her room and scribbled a note, enclosed it in an
envelope, and rang the bell.
</p>

<p>
The servant answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell John to take this to Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s lodgings at once; and if
he should be out, to follow him till he finds him, and deliver it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, miss.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later Mr. Plowden got the following note:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come here at once. Eva has heard from Ernest Kershaw, and announces her
intention of throwing you over and marrying him. Be prepared for a struggle,
but do not show that you have heard from me. You must find means to hold your
own. Burn this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden whistled as he laid the paper down. Going to his desk, he unlocked
it, and extracted the letter he had received from Eva, in which she
acknowledged her engagement to him, and then, seizing his hat, walked swiftly
towards the Cottage.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Florence made her way downstairs again, saying to herself as she
went, &ldquo;An unlucky chance. If I had seen the letter first, I would have
burned it. But we shall win yet. She has not the stamina to stand out against
that brute.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As soon as she reached the dining-room Eva began to say something more about
her letter, but her sister stopped her quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me have my breakfast in peace, Eva. We will talk of the letter
afterwards. He does not interest me, your Ernest, and it takes away my appetite
to talk business at meals.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva ceased, and sat silent; breakfast had no charms for her that morning.
</p>

<p>
Presently there was a knock at the door, and Mr. Plowden entered with a smile
of forced gaiety on his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Florence?&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;how do you do, dear Eva?
You see I have come to see you early this morning. I want a little refreshment
to enable me to get through my day&rsquo;s duty. The early suitor has come to
pick up the worm of his affections,&rdquo; and he laughed at his joke.
</p>

<p>
Florence shuddered at the simile, and thought to herself that there was a fair
chance of the affectionate worm disagreeing with the early suitor.
</p>

<p>
Eva said nothing. She sat quite still and pale.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, what is the matter with you both? Have you seen a ghost?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not exactly; but I think that Eva has received a message from the
dead,&rdquo; said Florence, with a nervous laugh.
</p>

<p>
Eva rose. &ldquo;I think, Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that I had
better be frank with you at once. I ask you to listen to me for a few
moments.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I not always at your service, dear Eva?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; began Eva, and broke down&mdash;&ldquo;I wish,&rdquo; she
went on again, &ldquo;to appeal to your generosity and to your feelings as a
gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden bowed with mock humility and smiled too&mdash;a very ugly smile.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are aware that, before I became engaged to you, I had had a
previous&mdash;affair.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With the boy who committed a murder,&rdquo; put in Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With a gentleman who had the misfortune to kill a man in a duel,&rdquo;
explained Eva.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Church and the law call it murder.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me, Mr. Plowden, we are dealing neither with the Church nor the
law; we are dealing with the thing as it is called among gentlemen and
ladies.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, misunderstandings, which I need not now enter into, arose with
reference to that affair, though, as I told you, I loved the man. To-day I have
heard from him, and his letter puts everything straight in my mind, and I see
how wrong and unjust has been my behaviour to him, and I know that I love him
more than ever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse the fellow&rsquo;s impudence!&rdquo; said the clergyman,
furiously; &ldquo;if he were here, I would give him a bit of my mind!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva&rsquo;s spirit rose, and she turned on him with flashing eyes, looking like
a queen in her imperial beauty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If he were here, Mr. Plowden, you would not dare to look him in the
face. Men like you only take advantage of the absent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The clergyman ground his teeth. He felt his furious temper rising and did not
dare to answer, though he was a bold man, in face of a woman. He feared lest it
should get beyond him; but beneath his breath he muttered, &ldquo;You shall pay
for that, my lady!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Under these circumstances,&rdquo; went on Eva, &ldquo;I appeal to you as
a gentleman to release me from an engagement into which, as you know, I have
been drawn more by force of circumstances than by my own wish. Surely, it is
not necessary for me to say any more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden rose and came and stood quite close to her, so that his face was
within a few inches of her eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Eva,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I am not going to be trifled with like this.
You have promised to marry me, and I shall keep you to your promise. You laid
yourself out to win my affection, the affection of an honest man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again Florence smiled, and Eva made a faint motion of dissent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but you did, you encouraged me. It is very well for you to deny it
now, when it suits your purpose, but you did, and you know it, and your sister
there knows it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence bowed her head in assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now you wish, in order to gratify an unlawful passion for a shedder
of blood&mdash;you wish to throw me over, to trample upon my holiest feelings,
and to rob me of the prize which I have won. No, Eva, I will not release
you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Surely, surely, Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; said Eva, faintly, for she was a
gentle creature, and the man&rsquo;s violence overwhelmed her, &ldquo;you will
not force me into a marriage which I tell you is repugnant to me? I appeal to
your generosity to release me. You can never oblige me to marry you when I tell
you that I do not love you, and that my whole heart is given to another
man.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden saw that his violence was doing its work, and determined to follow
it up. He raised his voice till it was almost a shout.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I will; I will not submit to such
wickedness. Love! that will come. I am quite willing to take my chance of it.
No, I tell you fairly that I will not let you off; and if you try to avoid
fulfilling your engagement to me I will do more: I will proclaim you all over
the country as a jilt; I will bring an action for breach of promise of marriage
against you&mdash;perhaps you did not know that men can do that as well as
women&mdash;and cover your name with disgrace! Look, I have your written
promise of marriage;&rdquo; and he produced her letter.
</p>

<p>
Eva turned to her sister.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Florence,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;cannot you say a word to help me? I am
overwhelmed.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I wish I could, Eva dear,&rdquo; answered her sister, kindly; &ldquo;but
how can I? What Mr. Plowden says is just and right. You are engaged to him, and
are in honour bound to marry him. O Eva, do not bring trouble and disgrace upon
us all by your obstinacy! You owe something to your name as well as to
yourself, and something to me too. I am sure that Mr. Plowden will be willing
to forget all about this if you will undertake never to allude to it
again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, certainly, Miss Florence. I am not revengeful; I only want my
rights.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva looked faintly from one to the other; her head sank, and great black rings
painted themselves beneath her eyes. The lily was broken at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very cruel,&rdquo; she said, slowly; &ldquo;but I suppose
it must be as you wish. Pray God I may die first, that is all!&rdquo; and she
put her hands to her head and stumbled from the room, leaving the two
conspirators facing each other.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, we got over that capitally,&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden, rubbing his
hands. &ldquo;There is nothing like taking the high hand with a woman. Ladies
must sometimes be taught that a gentleman has rights as well as
themselves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence turned on him with bitter scorn.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Gentlemen!</i> Mr. Plowden, why is the word so often on your lips?
Surely, after the part you have just played, you do not presume to rank
yourself among <i>gentlemen?</i> Listen! it suits my purposes that you should
marry Eva, and you shall marry her; but I will not stoop to play the hypocrite
with a man like you. You talk of yourself as a gentleman, and do not scruple to
force an innocent girl into a wicked marriage, and to crush her spirit with
your cunning cruelty. A <i>gentleman</i> forsooth!&mdash;a satyr, a devil in
disguise!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am only asserting my rights,&rdquo; he said, furiously; &ldquo;and
whatever I have done, you have done more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not try your violence on me, Mr. Plowden; it will not do. I am not
made of the same stuff as your victim. Lower your voice, or leave the house and
do not enter it again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s heavy under-jaw fell a little; he was terribly afraid of
Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;listen! I do not choose that you should
labour under any mistake. I hold your hand in this business, though to have to
do with you in any way is in itself a defilement,&rdquo; and she wiped her
delicate fingers on a pocket-handkerchief as she said the word, &ldquo;because
I have an end of my own to gain. Not a vulgar end like yours, but a revenge,
which shall be almost divine or diabolical, call it which you will, in its
completeness. Perhaps it is a madness, perhaps it is an inspiration, perhaps it
is a fate. Whatever it is, it animates me body and soul, and I will gratify it,
though to do so I have to use a tool like you. I wished to explain this to you.
I wished, too, to make it clear to you that I consider you contemptible. I have
done both, and I have now the pleasure to wish you good-morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden left the house white with fury, and cursing in a manner remarkable
in a clergyman.

<p>
&ldquo;If she wasn&rsquo;t so handsome, hang me if I would not throw the whole
thing up!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
Needless to say, he did nothing of the sort; he only kept out of
Florence&rsquo;s way.

<h2><a name="chap30"></a>CHAPTER XIV.<br/>
THE VIRGIN MARTYR</h2>

<p>
Dorothy, in her note to Ernest that he received by the mail previous to the one
that brought the letters which at a single blow laid the hope and promise of
his life in the dust, it may be remembered, had stated her intention of going
to see Eva in order to plead Ernest&rsquo;s cause; but what with one thing and
another, her visit was considerably delayed. Twice she was on the point of
going, and twice something occurred to prevent her. The fact of the matter was,
the errand was distasteful, and she was in no hurry to execute it. She loved
Ernest herself, and, however deep that love might be trampled down, however
fast it might be chained in the dungeons of her secret thoughts, it was still
there, a living thing, an immortal thing. She could tread it down and chain it;
she could not kill it. Its shade would rise and walk in the upper chambers of
her heart, and wring its hands and cry to her, telling what it suffered in
those subterranean places, whispering how bitterly it envied the bright and
happy life which moved in the free air, and had usurped the love it claimed. It
was hard to have to ignore those pleadings, to disregard those cries for pity,
and to say that there was no hope, that it must always be chained, till time
ate away the chains. It was harder still to have to be one of the actual
ministers to the suffering. Still, she meant to go. Her duty to Ernest was not
to be forsaken because it was a painful duty.
</p>

<p>
On two or three occasions she met Eva, but got no opportunity of speaking to
her. Either her sister Florence was with her, or she was obliged to return
immediately. The truth was that, after the scene described in the last chapter,
Eva was subjected to the closest espionage. At home, Florence watched her as a
cat watches a mouse; abroad, Mr. Plowden seemed to be constantly hovering on
her flank, or, if he was not there, then she became aware of the presence of
the ancient and contemplative mariner who traded in Dutch cheeses. Mr. Plowden
feared lest she should run away, and so cheat him of his prize; Florence, lest
she should confide in Dorothy, or possibly Mr. Cardus, and, supported by them,
find the courage to assert herself and defraud her of her revenge. So they
watched her every movement.
</p>

<p>
At last Dorothy made up her mind to wait no longer for opportunities, but to go
and see Eva at her own home. She knew nothing of the Plowden imbroglio; but it
did strike her as curious that no one had said anything about Ernest. He had
written; it was scarcely likely the letter had miscarried. How was it that Eva
had not said anything on the subject? Little did Dorothy guess that, even as
these thoughts were passing through her mind, a great vessel was steaming out
of Southampton docks, bearing those epistles of final renunciation which
Ernest, very little to his satisfaction, received in due course.
</p>

<p>
Full of these reflections, Dorothy found herself one lovely spring afternoon
knocking at the door of the Cottage. Eva was at home, and she was at once
ushered into her presence. She was sitting on a low chair&mdash;the same on
which Ernest always pictured her with that confounded Skye terrier she was so
fond of kissing&mdash;an open book upon her knee, and looking out at the little
garden and the sea beyond. She looked pale and thin, Dorothy thought.
</p>

<p>
On her visitor&rsquo;s entrance, Eva rose and kissed her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am so glad to see you,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;I was feeling
lonely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Lonely!&rdquo; answered Dorothy, in her straightforward way; &ldquo;why,
I have been trying to find you alone for the last fortnight, and have never
succeeded.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva coloured. &ldquo;One may be lonely with ever so many people round
one.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then for a minute or so they talked about the weather; so persistently did they
discuss it, indeed, that the womanly instinct of each told her that the other
was fencing.
</p>

<p>
After all, it was Eva who broke the ice first.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you heard from Ernest lately?&rdquo; she said, nervously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I got a note by last mall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Eva, clasping her hands involuntarily, &ldquo;what did
he say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing much. But I got a letter by the mail before that, in which he
said a good deal. Among other things, he said he had written to you. Did you
get the letter?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva coloured to her eyes. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she whispered.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy rose, and seated herself again on a footstool by Eva&rsquo;s feet, and
wondered at the trouble in her eyes. How could she be troubled when she had
heard from Ernest&mdash;&ldquo;like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What did you answer him, dear?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva covered her face with her hands.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not talk about it,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is too dreadful to
me!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What can you mean? He tells me you are engaged to him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes&mdash;that is, no. I was half engaged. Now I am engaged to Mr.
Plowden.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy gave a gasp of horrified astonishment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Engaged to that man when you were engaged to Ernest! You must be
joking.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Dorothy, I am not joking; I wish to Heaven I were. I am engaged to
him. I am to marry him in less than a month. O, pity me, I am wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean to tell me,&rdquo; said Dorothy rising, &ldquo;that you are
engaged to Mr. Plowden when you love Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, oh yes; I cannot help&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment the door opened, and Florence entered, attended by Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
Her keen eyes saw at once that something was wrong, and her intelligence told
her what it was. After her bold fashion, she determined to take the bull by the
horns. Unless something were done, with Dorothy at her back, Eva might prove
obdurate after all.
</p>

<p>
Advancing, she shook Dorothy cordially by the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I see from your face,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you have just heard
the good news. Mr. Plowden is so shy that he would not consent to announce it
before; but here he is to receive your congratulations.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden took the cue, and advanced effusively on Dorothy with outstretched
hand. &ldquo;Yes, Miss Jones, I am sure you will congratulate me; and I ought
to be congratulated. I am the luckiest&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here he broke off. It really was very awkward. His hand remained limply hanging
in the air before Dorothy, but not the slightest sign did that dignified little
lady show of taking it. On the contrary, she drew herself up to her full
height&mdash;which was not very tall&mdash;and fixing her steady blue eyes on
the clergyman&rsquo;s shifty orbs, deliberately placed her right hand behind
her back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I do not shake hands with people who play such tricks,&rdquo; she said,
quietly.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s hand fell to his side, and he stepped back. He did not
expect such courage in anything so small. Florence, however, sailed in to the
rescue.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Dorothy, we do not quite understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, I think you do, Florence, or if you do not, then I will explain.
Eva here was engaged to marry Ernest Kershaw. Eva here has just with her own
lips told me that she still loves Ernest, but that she is obliged to
marry&mdash;that man;&rdquo; and she pointed with her little forefinger at Mr.
Plowden, who recoiled another step. &ldquo;Is not that true, Eva?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva bowed her head by way of answer. She still sat in the low chair, with her
hands over her face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really, Dorothy, I fail to see what right you have to interfere in this
matter,&rdquo; said Florence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have the right of common justice, Florence&mdash;the right a friend
has to protect the absent. Are you not ashamed of such a wicked plot to wrong
an absent man? Is there no way&rdquo; (addressing Mr. Plowden) &ldquo;in which
I can appeal to your feelings, to induce you to free this wretched girl you
have entrapped?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I only ask my own,&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden, sulkily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For shame! for shame! and you a minister of God&rsquo;s Word! And you
too, Florence! Oh, now I can read your heart, and see the bad thoughts looking
from your eyes!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence for a moment was abashed, and turned her face aside.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you, Eva&mdash;how can you become a party to such a shameful thing?
You, a good girl, to sell yourself away from dear Ernest to such a man as
that;&rdquo; and again she pointed contemptuously at Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, don&rsquo;t, Dorothy, don&rsquo;t; it is my duty. You don&rsquo;t
understand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Eva, I do understand. I understand that it is your duty to drown
yourself before you do such a thing, I am a woman as well as you, and though I
am not beautiful, I have a heart and a conscience, and I understand only too
well.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You will be lost if you drown yourself&mdash;I mean it is very
wicked,&rdquo; said Mr. Plowden to Eva, suddenly assuming his clerical
character as most likely to be effective. The suggestion alarmed him. He had
bargained for a live Eva.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Mr. Plowden,&rdquo; went on Dorothy, &ldquo;you are right: it would
be wicked, but not so wicked as to marry you. God gave us women our lives, but
He put a spirit in our hearts which tells us that we should rather throw them
away than suffer ourselves to be degraded. Oh, Eva, tell me that you will not
do this shameful thing. No, do not whisper to her, Florence.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dorothy, Dorothy,&rdquo; said Eva, rising and wringing her hands,
&ldquo;it is all useless. Do not break my heart with your cruel words. I must
marry him. I have fallen into the power of people who do not know what mercy
is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Florence.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Plowden scowled darkly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I have done;&rdquo; and Dorothy walked towards the door. Before she
reached it she paused and turned. &ldquo;One word, and I will trouble you no
more. What do you all expect will come of this wicked marriage?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
There was no answer. Then Dorothy went.
</p>

<p>
But her efforts did not stop there. She made her way straight to Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Reginald,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I have such dreadful news for you.
There, let me cry a little first, and I will tell you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And she did, telling him the whole story from beginning to end. It was entirely
new to him, and he listened with some astonishment, and with a feeling of
something like indignation against Ernest. He had intended that young gentleman
to fall in love with Dorothy, and behold, he had fallen in love with Eva. Alas
for the perversity of youth!
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; he said, when she had done, &ldquo;and what do you wish me
to do? It seems that you have to do with a heartless scheming woman, a clerical
cad, and a beautiful fool. One might deal with the schemer and the fool, but no
power on earth can soften the cad. At least, that is my experience. Besides, I
think the whole thing is much better left alone. I should be very sorry to see
Ernest married to a woman so worthless as this Eva must be. She is handsome, it
is true, and that is about all she is, as far as I can see. Don&rsquo;t
distress yourself, my dear; he will get over it, and after he has had his fling
out there, and lived down that duel business, he will come home, and if he is
wise, I know where he will look for consolation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy tossed her head and coloured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is not a question of consolation,&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;it is a
question of Ernest&rsquo;s happiness in life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t alarm yourself, Dorothy; people&rsquo;s happiness is not so
easily affected. He will forget all about her in a year.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that men always talk of each other like that, Reginald,&rdquo;
said Dorothy, resting her head upon her hands, and looking straight at the old
gentleman. &ldquo;Each of you likes to think that he has a monopoly of feeling,
and that the rest of his kind are as shallow as a milk-pan. And yet it was only
last night that you were talking to me about my mother. You told me, you
remember, that life had been a worthless thing to you since she was torn from
you, which no success had been able to render pleasant. You said more: you said
that you hoped that the end was not far off; that you had suffered enough and
waited enough; and that, though you had not seen her face for five-and-twenty
years, you loved her as wildly as you did the day when she first promised to
become your wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus had risen, and was looking through the glass door at the blooming
orchids. Dorothy got up, and, following him, laid her hand upon his shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Reginald,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;think! Ernest is about to be robbed of
his wife under circumstances curiously like those by which you were robbed of
yours. Unless it is prevented, what you have suffered all your life that he
will suffer also. Remember you are of the same blood, and, allowing for the
difference between your ages, of very much the same temperament too. Think how
different life would have been to you if any one had staved off your disaster,
and then I am sure you will do all you can to stave off his.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Life would have been non-existent for you,&rdquo; he answered,
&ldquo;for you would never have been born.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well,&rdquo; she said, with a little sigh, &ldquo;I am sure I should
have got on very well without. I could have spared myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus was a keen man, and could see as far into the human heart as most.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Girl,&rdquo; he said, contracting his white eyebrows and suddenly
turning round upon her, &ldquo;you love Ernest yourself. I have often suspected
it; now I am sure you do.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy flinched.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she answered, &ldquo;I do love him. What then?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And yet you are advocating my interference to secure his marriage with
another woman, a worthless creature who does not know her own mind. You cannot
really care about him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Care about him!&rdquo; and she turned her sweet blue eyes upwards.
&ldquo;I love him with all my heart and soul and strength. I have always loved
him; I always shall love him. I love him so well that I can do my duty to him,
Reginald. It is my duty to strain every nerve to prevent this marriage. I had
rather that my heart should ache than Ernest&rsquo;s. I implore of you to help
me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dorothy, it has always been my dearest wish that you should marry
Ernest. I told him so just before that unhappy duel. I love you both. All the
fibres of my heart that are left alive have wound themselves around you. Jeremy
I could never care for. Indeed, I fear that I used sometimes to treat the boy
harshly. He reminds me so of his father. And do you know, my dear, I sometimes
think that on that point I am not quite sane. But because you have asked me to
do it, and because you have quoted your dear mother&mdash;may peace be with
her!&mdash;I will do what I can. This girl Eva is of age, and I will write and
offer her a home. She need fear no persecution here.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are kind and good, Reginald, and I thank you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The letter shall go by to-night&rsquo;s post. But run away now; I see my
friend De Talor coming to speak to me;&rdquo; and the white eyebrows drew near
together in a way that it would have been unpleasant for the great De Talor to
behold. &ldquo;That business is drawing towards its end.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Reginald,&rdquo; answered Dorothy, shaking her forefinger at him in
her old childish way, &ldquo;haven&rsquo;t you given up those ideas yet? They
are very wrong.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, Dorothy. I shall give them up soon, when I have squared
accounts with De Talor. A year or two more&mdash;a stern chase is a long chase,
you know&mdash;and the thing will be done, and then I shall become a good
Christian again.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The letter was written. It offered Eva a home and protection.
</p>

<p>
In due course an answer, signed by Eva herself, came back. It thanked him for
his kindness, and regretted that circumstances and &ldquo;her sense of
duty&rdquo; prevented her from accepting the offer.
</p>

<p>
Then Dorothy felt that she had done all that in her lay, and gave the matter
up.
</p>

<p class="p2">
</p>

<p>
It was about this time that Florence drew another picture. It represented Eva
as Andromeda gazing hopelessly in the dim light of a ghastly dawn out across a
glassy sea; and far away in the oily depths there was a ripple, and beneath the
ripple a form travelling towards the chained maiden. The form had a human head
and cold gray eyes, and its features were those of Mr. Plowden.
</p>

<p>
And so, day by day, Destiny, throned in space, shot her flaming shuttle from
darkness into darkness, and the time passed on, as the time must pass, till the
inevitable end of all things is attained.
</p>

<p>
Eva existed and suffered, and that was all she did. She scarcely ate, or drank,
or slept. But still she lived; she was not brave enough to die, and the chains
were riveted too tight round her tender wrists to let her flee away. Poor
nineteenth-century Andromeda! No Perseus shall come to save you.
</p>

<p>
The sun rose and set in his appointed course, the flowers bloomed and died,
children were born, and the allotted portion of mankind passed onwards to its
rest; but no godlike Perseus came flying out of the golden east.
</p>

<p>
Once more the sun rose. The dragon heaved his head above the quiet waters, and
she was lost. By her own act, of her own folly and weakness, she was undone.
Behold her! the wedding is over. The echoes of the loud mockery of the bells
have scarcely died upon the noonday air, and in her chamber, the chamber of her
free and happy maiden-hood, the virgin martyr stands alone.
</p>

<p>
It is done. There lie the sickly scented flowers; there, too, the bride&rsquo;s
white robe. It is done. Oh, that life were done too, that she might once press
her lips to his and die!
</p>

<p>
The door opens, and Florence stands before her, pale, triumphant,
awe-inspiring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must congratulate you, my dear Eva. You really went through the
ceremony very well; only you looked like a statue.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Florence, why do you come to mock me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mock you, Eva, mock you! I come to wish you joy as Mr. Plowden&rsquo;s
wife. I hope that you will be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Happy! I shall never be happy. I detest him!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You detest him, and you marry him; there must be some mistake.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no mistake. O Ernest, my darling!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Florence smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If Ernest is your darling, why did you not marry Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How could I marry him when you forced me into this?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forced you! A free woman of full age cannot be forced. You married Mr.
Plowden of your own will. You might have married Ernest Kershaw if you
chose&mdash;he is in many ways a more desirable match than Mr.
Plowden&mdash;but you did not choose.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Florence, what do you mean? You always said it was impossible. Is this
all some cruel plot of yours?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Impossible! there is nothing impossible to those who have courage.
Yes,&rdquo; and she turned upon her sister fiercely, &ldquo;it <i>was</i> a
plot, and you shall know it, you poor weak fool! <i>I</i> loved Ernest Kershaw,
and <i>you</i> robbed me of him, although you promised to leave him alone; and
so I have revenged myself upon you. I despise you, I tell you; you are quite
contemptible, and yet he could prefer you to me. Well, he has got his reward.
You have deserted him when he was absent and in trouble, and you have outraged
his love and your own. You have fallen very low indeed, Eva, and presently you
will fall lower yet. I know you well. You will sink, till at last you even lose
the sense of your own humiliation. Don&rsquo;t you wonder what Ernest must
think of you now? There is Mr. Plowden calling you. Come, it is time for you to
be going.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva listened aghast, and then sank against the wall, sobbing despairingly.

<h2><a name="chap31"></a>CHAPTER XV.<br/>
HANS&rsquo;S CITY OF REST</h2>

<p>
Mr. Alston, Ernest, and Jeremy had very good sport among the elephants, killing
in all nineteen bulls. It was during this expedition that an incident occurred
which in its effect endeared Ernest to Mr. Alston more than ever.
</p>

<p>
The boy Roger, who always went wherever Mr Alston went, was the object of his
father&rsquo;s most tender solicitude. He believed in the boy as he believed in
little else in the world&mdash;for at heart Mr. Alston was a sad
cynic&mdash;and to a certain extent the boy justified his belief. He was quick,
intelligent, and plucky, much such a boy as you may pick up by the dozen out of
any English public school, except that his knowledge of men and manners was
more developed, as is usual among young colonists. At the age of twelve Master
Roger Alston knew many things denied to most children of his age. On the
subject of education Mr. Alston had queer ideas. &ldquo;The best education for
a boy,&rdquo; he would say, &ldquo;is to mix with grown-up gentlemen. If you send him
to school, he learns little except mischief; if you let him live with
gentlemen, he learns, at any rate, to be a gentleman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But whatever Master Roger knew, he did not know much about elephants, and on
this point he was destined to gain some experience.
</p>

<p>
One day&mdash;it was just after they had got into the elephant
country&mdash;they were all engaged in following the fresh spoor of a solitary
bull. But though an elephant is a big beast, it is hard work catching him up
because he never seems to get tired, and this was exactly what our party of
hunters found. They followed that energetic elephant for hours, but they could
not catch him, though the spoorers told them that he was certainly not more
than a mile or so ahead. At last the sun began to get low, and their legs had
already got weary; so they gave it up for that day, determining to camp where
they were. This being so, after a rest, Ernest and the boy Roger started out of
camp to see if they could not shoot a buck or some birds for supper. Roger had
a repeating Winchester carbine, Ernest a double-barrelled shot-gun. Hardly had
they left the camp when Aasv&ouml;gel, Jeremy&rsquo;s Hottentot, came running
in, and reported that he had seen the elephant, an enormous bull with a white
spot upon his trunk, feeding in a clump of mimosa, not a quarter of a mile
away. Up jumped Mr. Alston and Jeremy, as fresh as though they had not walked a
mile, and, seizing their double-eight elephant rifles, started off with
Aasv&ouml;gel.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Ernest and Roger had been strolling towards this identical clump of
mimosa. As they neared it, the former saw some guinea-fowl run into the shelter
of the trees.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Capital!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Guinea-fowl are first-class eating. Now,
Roger, just you go into the bush and drive the flock over me. I&rsquo;ll stand
here, and make believe they are pheasants.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The lad did as he was bid. But in order to get well behind the covey of
guinea-fowl, which are dreadful things to run, he made a little circuit through
the thickest part of the clump. As he did so his quick eye was arrested by a
most unusual performance on the part of one of the flat-crowned mimosa-trees.
Suddenly, and without the slightest apparent reason, it rose into the air, and
then, behold! where its crown had been a moment before, appeared its roots.
</p>

<p>
Such an &ldquo;Alice in Wonderland&rdquo; sort of performance on the part of a
tree could not but excite the curiosity of an intelligent youth. Accordingly,
Roger pushed forwards, and slipped round an intervening tree. This was what he
saw: In a little glade about ten paces from him, flapping its ears, stood an
enormous elephant with great white tusks, looking as large as a house and as
cool as a cucumber. Nobody, to look at the brute, would have believed that he
had given them a twenty miles&rsquo; trot under a burning sun. He was now
refreshing himself by pulling up mimosa-trees as easily as though they were
radishes, and eating the sweet fibrous roots.
</p>

<p>
Roger saw this, and his heart burned with ambition to kill that
elephant&mdash;the mighty great beast, about a hundred times as big as himself,
who could pull up a large tree and make his dinner off the roots. Roger was a
plucky boy, and, in his sportsmanlike zeal, he quite forgot that a repeating
carbine is not exactly the weapon one would choose to shoot elephants with.
Indeed, without giving the matter another thought, he lifted the little rifle,
aimed it at the great beast&rsquo;s head, and fired. He hit it somewhere, that
was very clear, for next moment the air resounded with the most terrific scream
of fury that it had ever been his lot to hear. That scream was too much for
him; he turned and fled swiftly. Elephants were evidently difficult things to
kill.
</p>

<p>
Fortunately for Roger, the elephant could not for some seconds make out where
his tiny assailant was. Presently, however, he winded him, and came crashing
after him, screaming shrilly, with his trunk and tail well up. On hearing the
shot and the scream of the elephant, Ernest, who was standing some way out in
the open, in anticipation of a driving shot at the guinea-fowl, had run towards
the spot where Roger had entered the bush; and, just as he got opposite to it,
out he came, scuttling along for his life, with the elephant not more than
twenty paces behind him.
</p>

<p>
Then Ernest did a brave thing.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">
<a name="illus11"></a>
<br />
<img src="images/fig11.jpg" width="402" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;Ernest did a brave thing.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;Make for the bush!&rdquo; he yelled to the boy, who at once swerved to
the right. On thundered the elephant, straight towards Ernest. But with Ernest
it was evident he considered he had no quarrel, for presently he tried to swing
himself round after Roger. Then Ernest lifted his shot-gun, and sent a charge
of No. 4 into the brute&rsquo;s face, stinging him sadly. It was, humanly
speaking, certain death which he courted, but at the moment his main idea was
to save the boy. Screaming afresh, the elephant abandoned the pursuit of Roger,
and made straight for Ernest, who fired the other barrel of small-shot, in the
vain hope of blinding him. By now the boy had pulled up, being some forty yards
off, and seeing Ernest just about to be crumpled up, wildly fired the repeating
rifle in their direction. Some good angel must have guided the little bullet;
for, as it happened, it struck the elephant in the region of the knee, and,
forcing its way in, slightly injured a tendon, and brought the great beast
thundering to the ground. Ernest had only just time to dodge to one side as the
huge mass came to the earth; indeed, as it was, he got a tap from the tip of
the elephant&rsquo;s trunk which knocked him down, and, though he did not feel
it at the time, made him sore for days afterwards. In a moment, however, he was
up again, and away at his best speed, legging it as he had never legged it
before in his life; and so was the elephant. People have no idea at what a pace
an elephant can go when he is out of temper, until they put it to the proof.
Had it not been for the slight injury to the knee, and the twenty yards&rsquo;
start he got, Ernest would have been represented by little pieces before he was
ten seconds older. As it was, when, a hundred and fifty yards farther on,
elephant and Ernest broke upon the astonished view of Mr. Alston and Jeremy,
who were hurrying up to the scene of action, they were almost one flesh; that
is, the tip of the elephant&rsquo;s trunk was now up in the air, and now about
six inches off the seat of Ernest&rsquo;s trousers, at which it snapped
convulsively.
</p>

<p>
Up went Jeremy&rsquo;s heavy rifle, which luckily he had in his hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behind the shoulder, half-way down the ear,&rdquo; said Mr. Alston,
beckoning to a Kafir to bring his rifle, which he was carrying. The probability
of Jeremy&rsquo;s stopping the beast at that distance&mdash;they were quite
sixty yards off&mdash;was infinitesimal.
</p>

<p>
There was a second&rsquo;s pause. The snapping tip touched the retreating
trousers, but did not get hold of them, and the contact sent a magnetic thrill
up Ernest&rsquo;s back.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Boom&mdash;thud&mdash;crash!&rdquo; and the elephant was down dead as a
door-nail. Jeremy had made no mistake: the bullet went straight through the
great brute&rsquo;s heart, and broke the shoulder on the other side. He was one
of those men who not only rarely miss, but always seem to hit their game in the
right place.
</p>

<p>
Ernest sank exhausted on the ground, and Mr. Alston and Jeremy rushed up
rejoicing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Near go that, Ernest,&rdquo; said the former.
</p>

<p>
Ernest nodded in reply. He could not speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove! where is Roger?&rdquo; he went on, turning pale as he missed
his son for the first time.
</p>

<p>
But at this moment that young gentleman hove in sight, and, recovering from his
fright when he saw that the great animal was stone-dead, rushed up with yells
of exultation, and, climbing on to the upper tusk, began to point out where he
had hit him.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile Mr. Alston had extracted the story of the adventure from Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You young rascal,&rdquo; he said to his son, &ldquo;come off that tusk.
Do you know that if it had not been for Mr. Kershaw here, who courted almost
certain death to save you from the results of your own folly, you would be as
dead as that elephant and as flat as a biscuit? Come down, sir, and offer up
your thanks to Providence and Mr. Kershaw that you have a sound square inch of
skin left on your worthless young body!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Roger descended accordingly, considerably crestfallen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never you mind, Roger; that was a most rattling good shot of yours at
his knee,&rdquo; said Ernest, who had now got his breath again. &ldquo;You
would not do it again if you fired at elephants for a week.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so the matter passed off; but afterwards Mr. Alston thanked Ernest with
tears in his eyes for saving his son&rsquo;s life.
</p>

<p>
This was the first elephant they killed, and also the largest. It measured ten
feet eleven inches at the shoulder, and the tusks weighed, when dried out,
about sixty pounds each.
</p>

<p>
They remained in the elephant country for nearly four months, when the approach
of the unhealthy season forced them to leave it&mdash;not, however, before they
had killed a great quantity of large game of all sorts. It was a most
successful hunt, so successful, indeed, that the ivory they brought down paid
all the expenses of the trip, and left a handsome surplus over.
</p>

<p>
It was on the occasion of their return to Pretoria that Ernest made the
acquaintance of a curious character in a curious way.
</p>

<p>
As soon as they reached the boundaries of the Transvaal, Ernest bought a horse
from a Boer, on which he used to ride after the herds of buck which swarmed
upon the high veldt. They had none with them, because in the country where they
had been shooting no horse would live. One day, as they were travelling slowly
along a little before midday, a couple of bull-vilderbeeste galloped across the
waggon-track about two hundred yards in front of the oxen. The voorlooper
stopped the oxen in order to give Ernest, who was sitting on the waggon-box
with a rifle by his side, a steady shot. Ernest fired at the last of the two
galloping bulls. The line was good; but he did not make sufficient allowance
for the pace at which the bull was travelling, with the result that instead of
striking it forwards and killing it, the bullet shattered its flank, and did
not stop its career.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dash it!&rdquo; said Ernest, when he saw what he had done, &ldquo;I
can&rsquo;t leave the poor beast like that. Bring me my horse; I will go after
him, and finish him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The horse, which was tied already saddled behind the waggon, was quickly
brought, and Ernest, mounting, told them not to keep the waggons for him, as he
would strike across country and meet them at the outspan place, about a mile or
so on. Then he started after his wounded bull, which could be plainly discerned
standing with one leg up on the crest of a rise about a thousand yards away.
But if ever a vilderbeeste was possessed by a fixed determination not to be
finished off, it was that particular vilderbeeste. The pace at which a
vilderbeeste can travel on three legs when he is not too fat is perfectly
astonishing, and Ernest had traversed a couple of miles of great rolling plain
before he even got within fair galloping distance of him. He had a good horse,
however, and at last he got within fifty yards, and then away they went at a
merry pace, Ernest&rsquo;s object being to ride alongside and put a bullet
through him. Their gallop lasted a good two miles or more. On the level, Ernest
gained on the vilderbeeste, but whenever they came to a patch of ant-bear holes
or a ridge of stones, the vilderbeeste had the pull, and drew away again. At
last they came to a dry pan or lake about half a mile broad, crowded with
hundreds of buck of all sorts, which scampered away as they came tearing along.
Here Ernest at length drew up level with his quarry, and grasping the rifle
with his right hand, tried to get it so that he could put a bullet through the
beast, and drop him. But it was no easy matter, as any one who has ever tried
it will know, and, while he was still making up his mind, the vilderbeeste
slewed round, and came at him bravely. Had his horse been unused to the work,
he must have had his inside ripped out by the crooked horns; but he was an old
hunter, and equal to the occasion. To turn was impossible, the speed was too
great, but he managed to slew, with the result that the charging animal brushed
his head, instead of landing himself in his belly. At the same moment Ernest
stretched out his rifle and pulled the trigger, and, as it chanced, put the
bullet right through the vilderbeeste and dropped him dead.
</p>

<p>
Then he pulled up, and, dismounting, cut off some of the best of the beef with
his hunting-knife, stowed it away in a saddle-bag, and set off on his horse,
now pretty well fagged, to find the waggons. But to find a waggon-track on the
great veldt, unless you have in the first instance taken the most careful
bearings, is almost as difficult as it would be to return from a distance to
any given spot on the ocean without a compass. There are no trees nor hills to
guide the traveller; nothing but a vast wilderness of land resembling a sea
petrified in a heavy swell.
</p>

<p>
Ernest rode on for three or four miles, as he thought, retracing his steps over
the line of country he had traversed, and at last, to his joy, struck the path.
There were waggon-tracks on it; but he thought they did not look quite fresh.
However, he followed them <i>faute de mieux</i> for some five miles. Then he
became convinced that they could not have been made by his waggons. He had
overshot the mark, and must hark back. So he turned his weary horse&rsquo;s
head, and made his way along the road to the spot where his spoor struck into
it. The waggons must be outspanned, waiting for him a little farther back. He
went on, one mile, two, three&mdash;no waggons. A little to the left of the
road was an eminence. He rode to it, and up and scanned the horizon. O joy!
there far away, five or six miles off, was the white cap of a waggon. He rode
to it straight across country. Once he got bogged in a vlei or swamp, and had
to throw himself off, and drag his horse out by the bridle. He struggled on,
and at last came to the dip in which he had seen the waggon-tent. It was a
great white stone perched on a mound of brown ones.
</p>

<p>
By this time he had utterly lost his reckoning. Just then, to make matters
worse, a thunder-shower came up with a bitter wind, and drenched him to the
skin. The rain passed, but the wind did not. It blew like ice, and chilled his
frame, enervated with the tropical heat in which he had been living, through
and through. He wandered on aimlessly, till suddenly his tired horse put his
foot in a hole and fell heavily, throwing him on to his head and shoulder. For
a few minutes his senses left him; but he recovered, and, mounting his worn-out
horse, wandered on again. Luckily, he had broken no bones. Had he done so, he
would probably have perished miserably in that lonely place.
</p>

<p>
The sun was sinking now, and he was faint for want of food, for he had eaten
nothing that day but a biscuit. He had not even a pipe of tobacco with him.
Just as the sun vanished he hit a little path, or what might once have been a
path. He followed it till the pitchy darkness set in; then he got off his horse
and took off the saddle, which he put down on the bare black veldt, for a fire
had recently swept off the dry grass, and wrapping the saddle-cloth round his
feet, laid his aching head upon the saddle. The reins he hitched round his arm,
lest the horse should stray away from him to look for food. The wind was
bitterly cold, and he was wet through; the hyenas came and howled round him. He
cut off a piece of the raw vilderbeeste-beef and chewed it, but it turned his
stomach and he spat it out. Then he shivered and sank into a torpor from which
there was a poor chance of his awakening.
</p>

<p>
How long he lay so he did not know&mdash;it seemed a few minutes; it was really
an hour when suddenly he was awakened by feeling something shaking him by the
shoulder.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he said wearily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wat is it? Ach Himmel! wat is it? dat is just wat I wants to know. Wat
do you here? You shall die so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The voice was the voice of a German, and Ernest knew German well.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have lost my way,&rdquo; he said, in that language; &ldquo;I cannot
find the waggons.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you can speak the tongue of the Vaterland,&rdquo; said his visitor,
still addressing him in English. &ldquo;I will embrace you!&rdquo; and he did
so.
</p>

<p>
Ernest sighed. It is a bore to be embraced in the dark by an unknown male
German when you feel that you are not far off dissolution.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are hungered?&rdquo; said the German.
</p>

<p>
Ernest signified that he was.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And athirsted?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Again he signified assent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And perhaps you have no &lsquo;gui&rsquo; (tobacco)?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, none.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good! my little wife, my Wilhelmina, shall find you all these
things.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What the devil,&rdquo; thought Ernest to himself, &ldquo;can a German be
doing with his little wife in this place?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
By this time the stars had come out, and gave some light.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, rouse yourself, and come and see my little wife. O, the
pferd!&rdquo; (horse)&mdash;&ldquo;we will tie him to my wife. Ah, she is
beautiful, though her leg shakes. O yes, you will love her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The deuce I shall!&rdquo; ejaculated Ernest; and then, mindful of the
good things the lady in question was to provide him with, he added solemnly,
&ldquo;Lead on, Macduff.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Macduffer! my name is not so, my name is Hans; all ze great South Africa
know me very well, and all South Africa love my wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Really!&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Although he was so miserable, he began to feel that the situation was
interesting. A lady to whom his horse was to be tied, and whom all South Africa
was enamoured of, could hardly fail to be interesting. Rising, he advanced a
step or two with his friend, who he could now see was a large burly man with
white hair, apparently about sixty years of age. Presently they came to
something that in the dim light reminded him of the hand-hearse in Kesterwick
Church, only it had two wheels instead of four, and no springs.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Behold my beautiful wife,&rdquo; said the German. &ldquo;Soon I will
show you how her leg shakes; it shakes, O, horrid!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is&mdash;is the lady inside?&rdquo; asked Ernest. It occurred to him
that his friend might be carting about a corpse.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inside! no, she is outside, she is all over;&rdquo; and stepping back,
the German put his head on one side in a most comical fashion, and, regarding
the unofficial hearse with the deepest affection, said in a low voice,
&ldquo;Ah, liebe vrouw, ah, Wilhelmina, is you tired, my dear? and how is your
poor leg?&rdquo; and he caught hold of a groggy wheel and shook it.
</p>

<p>
Had Ernest been a little less wretched, and one degree further off starvation,
it is probable that he would have exploded with laughter, for he had a keen
sense of the ludicrous; but he had not got a laugh left in him, and, besides,
he was afraid of offending the German. So he merely murmured, &ldquo;Poor, poor
leg!&rdquo; sympathetically, and then alluded to the question of eatables.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, of course. Let us see what Wilhelmina shall give us;&rdquo; and
he trotted round to the back end of the cart, which, in keeping with its
hearse-like character, opened by means of two little folding-doors, and pulled
out, first, two blankets, one of which he gave to Ernest to put round his
shoulders; second, a large piece of biltong, or sun-dried game-flesh, and some
biscuits; and, third, a bottle of peach-brandy. On these viands they fell to,
and though they were not in themselves of an appetising nature, Ernest never
enjoyed anything more in his life. Their meal did not take long, and after it
his friend Hans produced some excellent Boer tobacco, and over their pipes
Ernest told him how he had lost his way. Hans asked him what road he had been
travelling on.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The Rustenburg road.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then, my friend, you are not more than one thousand paces off it. My
wife and I we travel along him all day, till just now Wilhelmina she think she
would like to come up here, and so I come, and now you see the reason why. She
know you lie here and die in the cold, and she turn up to save your life. Ah,
the good woman!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest was greatly relieved to hear that he was so near the road, as, once upon
it, he would have no difficulty in falling in with the waggons. Clearly, during
the latter part of his wanderings, he must have unknowingly approached it. His
mind, relieved upon this point, was at liberty to satisfy his curiosity about
his friend. He soon discovered that he was a harmless lunatic, whose craze it
was to wander all over South Africa, dragging his hand-cart after him. He made
for no fixed point, nor had he any settled round. The beginning of the year
might find him near the Zambesi, and the end near Cape Town or anywhere else.
By the natives he was looked upon as inspired, and invariably treated with
respect, and he lived upon what was given to him, or what he shot as he walked
along. This mode of life he had pursued for years, and though he had many
adventures, he never came to harm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, my friend,&rdquo; said the simple man, in answer to
Ernest&rsquo;s inquiries, &ldquo;I make my wife down there in Scatterdorp, in
the old colony. The houses are a long way off each other there, and the church
it is in the middle. And the good volk there, they die very fast, and did get
tired of carrying each other to be buried, and so they come to me and say,
&lsquo;Hans, you are a carpenter, you must make a beautiful black cart to put
us in when we die.&rsquo; And so I set to, and I work, and work, and work at my
cart till I gets quite&mdash;what you call him?&mdash;stoopid. And then one
night, just as my cart was finished, I dreams that she and I are travelling
along a wide straight road, like the road on the high veldt, and I knows that
she is my wife, and that we must travel always together till we reach the City
of Rest. And far, far away, above the top of a high mountain like the
Drakensberg, I see a great wide tree, rooted on a cloud and covered all over
with beautiful snow, that shined in the sunlight like the diamonds at
Kimberley. And I know that under that tree is the gate of the real Rustenburg,
the City of Rest, and my wife and I, we must journey on, on, on till we find
it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where do you come from now?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;From Utrecht, from out of the east, where the sun rises so red every
morning over Zululand, the land of bloodshed. O, the land will run with blood
there. I know it; Wilhelmina told me as we came along; but I don&rsquo;t know
when. But you are tired. Good! you shall sleep with Wilhelmina; I will sleep
beneath her. No, you shall, or she will be&mdash;what you call
him?&mdash;offended.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest crept into the cavity, and at once fell asleep, and dreamed that he had
been buried alive. Suddenly in the middle of the night there was a most fearful
jolt, caused by his horse, which was tied to the pole of Wilhelmina, having
pulled the prop aside and let the pole down with a run. This Ernest mistook for
the resurrection, and was extremely relieved to find himself in error. At dawn
he emerged, bade his friend farewell, and gaining the road, rejoined the
waggons in safety.

<h2><a name="chap32"></a>CHAPTER XVI.<br/>
ERNEST ACCEPTS A COMMISSION</h2>

<p>
A YOUNG man of that ardent, impetuous, intelligent mind which makes him
charming and a thing to love, as contrasted with the young man of the sober,
cautious, moneymaking mind (infinitely the most useful article), which makes
him a &ldquo;comfort&rdquo; to his relatives and a thing to respect, avoid, and
marry your daughter to, has two great safeguards standing between him and the
ruin which dogs the heels of the ardent, the impetuous, and the intelligent.
These are, his religion and his belief in women. It is probable that he will
start on his erratic career with a full store of both. He has never questioned
the former; the latter, so far as his own class in life is concerned, are to
him all sweet and good, and perhaps there is one particular star who only
shines for him, and is the sweetest and best of them all. But one fine day the
sweetest and best of all throws him over, being a younger son, and marries his
eldest brother, or a paralytic cotton-spinner of enormous wealth and uncertain
temper, and then a sudden change comes over the spirit of the ardent,
intelligent, and impetuous one. Not being of a well-balanced mind, he rushes to
the other extreme, and believes in his sore heart that all women would throw
over such as he and marry eldest brothers or superannuated cotton-spinners. He
may be right or he may be wrong. The materials for ascertaining the fact are
wanting, for all women engaged to impecunious young gentlemen do not get the
chance. But, right or wrong, the result upon the sufferer is the same&mdash;his
faith in women is shaken, if not destroyed. Nor does the mischief stop there;
his religion often follows his belief in the other sex, for in some mysterious
way the two things are interwoven. A young man of the nobler class of mind in
love is generally for the time being a religious man; his affection lifts him
more or less above the things of earth, and floats him on its radiant wings a
day&rsquo;s journey nearer heaven.
</p>

<p>
The same thing applies conversely. If a man&rsquo;s religious belief is
emasculated, he becomes suspicious of the &ldquo;sweetest and best;&rdquo; he
grows cynical, and no longer puts faith in superlatives. From atheism there is
but a small step to misogyny, or rather to that disbelief in humanity which
embraces a profounder constituent disbelief in its feminine section, and in
turn, as already said, the misogynist walks daily along the edge of atheism. Of
course there is a way out of these discouraging results. If the mind that
suffers and falls through its suffering be of the truly noble order, it may in
time come to see that this world is a world not of superlatives, but of the
most arid positives, with here and there a little comparative oasis to break
the monotony of its general outline. Its owner may learn that the fault lay
with him, for believing too much, for trusting too far, for setting up as an
idol a creature exactly like himself, only several degrees lower beneath proof;
and at last he may come to see that though &ldquo;sweetests and bests&rdquo;
are chimerical, there are women in the world who may fairly be called
&ldquo;sweet and good.&rdquo; Or, to return to the converse side of the
picture, it may occur to our young gentleman that although Providence starts us
in the world with a full inherited or indoctrinated belief in a given religion,
that is not what Providence understands by faith. Faith, perfect faith, is only
to be won by struggle, and in most cultivated minds by the passage through the
dim, mirage-clad land of disbelief. The true believer is he who has trodden
down disbelief, not he who has run away from it. When we have descended from
the height of our childhood, when we have entertained Apollyon, and having
considered what he has to say, given him battle and routed him in the plain,
then, and not till then, can we say with guileless hearts, &ldquo;Lord, I
believe,&rdquo; and feel no need to add the sadly qualifying words, &ldquo;help
Thou mine unbelief.&rdquo; Now these are more or less principles of human
nature. They may not be universally true, probably nothing is&mdash;that is, as
we define and understand truth. But they apply to the majority of those cases
which fall strictly within their limits. Among others they applied rather
strikingly to Ernest Kershaw. Eva&rsquo;s desertion struck his belief in
womanhood to the ground, and soon his religion lay in the dust beside it. Of
this his life for some years after that event gave considerable evidence. He
took to evil ways, he forgot his better self. He raced horses, he devoted
himself with great success to love-affairs that he would have done better to
leave alone. Sometimes, to his shame be it said, he drank&mdash;for the
excitement of drinking, not for the love of it. In short, he gave himself and
all his fund of energy up to any and every excitement and dissipation he could
command, and he managed to command a good many. Travelling rapidly from place
to place in South Africa, he was well known and well liked in all. Now he was
at Kimberley, now at King William&rsquo;s Town, now at Durban. In each of these
places he kept race-horses; in each there was some fair woman&rsquo;s face that
grew the brighter for his coming.
</p>

<p>
But Ernest&rsquo;s face did not grow the brighter; on the contrary, his eyes
acquired a peculiar sadness which was almost pathetic in one so young. He could
not forget. For a few days or a few months he might stifle thought, but it
always re-arose. Eva, pale queen of women, was ever there to haunt his sleep,
and though in his waking hours he might curse her memory, when night drew the
veil from truth the words he murmured were words of love eternal.
</p>

<p>
He no longer prayed, he no longer reverenced woman, but he was not the happier
for having freed his soul from these burdens. He despised himself. Occasionally
he would take stock of his mental condition, and at each such stocktaking he
would notice that he had receded, not progressed. He was growing coarse, his
finer sense was being blunted; he was no longer the same Ernest who had written
that queer letter to his betrothed before disaster overwhelmed him. Slowly and
surely he was sinking. He knew it, but he did not try to save himself. Why
should he? He had no object in life. But at times a great depression and
weariness of existence would take possession of him. It has been said that he
never prayed; that is not strictly true. Once or twice he did throw himself
upon his knees and pray with all his strength that he might die. He did more:
he persistently courted death, and, as is usual in such cases, it persistently
avoided him. About taking his own life he had scruples, or perhaps he would
have taken it. In those dark days he hated life, and in his calmer and more
reflective moments he loathed the pleasures and excitements by means of which
he strove to make it palatable. His was a fine strung mind, and, in spite of
himself, he shuddered when it was set to play such coarse music.
</p>

<p>
During those years Ernest seemed to bear a charmed existence. There was a
well-known thoroughbred horse in the Transvaal which had killed two men in
rapid succession. Ernest bought it and rode it, and it never hurt him.
Disturbances broke out in Secocoeni&rsquo;s country, and one of the chief
strongholds was ordered to be stormed. Ernest rode down from Pretoria with
Jeremy to see the fun, and, reaching the fort the day before the attack, got
leave to join the storming party. Accordingly, next day at dawn they attacked
in the teeth of a furious fusillade, and in time took the place, though with
very heavy loss to themselves. Jeremy&rsquo;s hat was shot off with one bullet
and his hand cut by another; Ernest, as usual, came off scathless; the man next
to him was killed, but he was not touched. After that he insisted upon going
buftalo-shooting towards Delagoa Bay in the height of the fever-season, having
got rid of Jeremy by persuading him to go to New Scotland to see about a tract
of land they had bought. He started with a dozen bearers and Mazooku. Six weeks
later he, Mazooku, and three bearers returned&mdash;all the rest were dead of
fever.
</p>

<p>
On another occasion, Alston, Jeremy, and himself were sent on a political
mission to a hostile chief, whose stronghold lay in the heart of almost
inaccessible mountains. The &ldquo;indaba&rdquo; (palaver) took all day, and
was purposely prolonged in order to enable the intelligent native to set an
ambush in the pass through which the white chiefs must go back, with strict
instructions to murder all three of them. When they left the stronghold the
moon was rising, and, as they neared the pass, up she came behind the mountains
in all her splendour, flooding the wide valley behind them with her mysterious
light, and throwing a pale, sad lustre on every stone and tree. On they rode
steadily through the moonlight and the silence, little guessing how near death
was to them. The faint beauty of the scene sank deep into Ernest&rsquo;s heart,
and presently, when they came to a spot where a track ran out loopwise from the
main pass, returning to it a couple of miles farther on, he half insisted on
their taking it, because it passed over yet higher ground, and would give them
a better view of the moon-bathed valley. Mr. Alston grumbled at &ldquo;his
nonsense&rdquo; and complied, and meanwhile a party of murderers half a mile
farther on played with their assegais, and wondered why they did not hear the
sound of the white men&rsquo;s feet. But the white men had already passed along
the higher path three-quarters of a mile to their right. Ernest&rsquo;s love of
moonlight effects had saved them all from a certain and perhaps from a
lingering death.
</p>

<p>
It was shortly after this incident that Ernest and Jeremy were seated together
on the verandah of the same house at Pretoria where they had been living before
they went on the elephant hunt, and which they had now purchased. Ernest had
been in the garden, watering a cucumber-plant he was trying to develop from a
very sickly seedling. Even if he only stopped a month in a place he would start
a little garden; it was a habit of his. Presently he came back to the verandah,
where Jeremy was as usual watching the battle of the red and black ants, which
after several years&rsquo; encounter was not yet finally decided.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Curse that cucumber-plant!&rdquo; said Ernest, emphatically, &ldquo;it
won&rsquo;t grow. I tell you what it is, Jeremy, I am sick of this place; I
vote we go away.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, Ernest, let us have a little rest; you do
rattle one about so in those confounded post-carts,&rdquo; replied Jeremy,
yawning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean, go away from South Africa altogether.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Jeremy, dragging his great frame into an upright
position, &ldquo;the deuce you do! And where do you want to go
to&mdash;England?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;England! no, I have had enough of England. South America, I think. But
perhaps you want to go home. It is not fair to keep dragging you all over the
world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear fellow, I like it, I assure you. I have no wish to return to Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s stool. For goodness&rsquo; sake don&rsquo;t suggest such a
thing; I should be wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, but you ought to be doing something with your life. It is all very
well for me, who am a poor devil of a waif and stray, to go on with this sort
of existence, but I don&rsquo;t see why you should; you should be making your
way in the world.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wait a bit, my hearty!&rdquo; said Jeremy, with his slow smile; &ldquo;I
am going to read you a statement of our financial affairs which I drew up last
night. Considering that we have been doing nothing all this time except enjoy
ourselves, and that all our investments have been made out of income, which no
doubt your respected uncle fancies were dissipated, I do not think that the
total is so bad. And Jeremy read:

<p>
Now of this we have actually saved and invested about twenty-five hundred, the
rest we have made or has accumulated. Now, I ask you, where could we have done
better than that, as things go? So don&rsquo;t talk to me about wasting my
time.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Bravo, Jeremy! My uncle was right, after all: you ought to have
been a lawyer; you are first-class at figures. I congratulate you on your
management of the estates.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My system is simple,&rdquo; answered Jeremy. Whenever there is any money
to spare I buy something with it then you are not likely to spend it. Then,
when I have things enough&mdash;waggons, oxen, horses, what not,&mdash;I sell
them and buy some land; that can&rsquo;t run away. If you only do that sort of
thing long enough, you will grow rich at last.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sweetly simple, certainly. Well, five thousand will go a Iong way
towards stocking a farm or something in South America or wherever we make up
our minds to go, and then I don&rsquo;t think that we need draw on my uncle any
more. It is hardly fair to drain him so. Old Alston will come with us, I think,
and will put in another five thousand. He told me some time ago that he was
getting tired of South Africa with its Boers and blacks, in his old age and had
a fancy to make a start in some other place. I will write to him to-night. What
hotel is he staying at in Maritzburg? the Royal, isn&rsquo;t it? And then I
vote we clear in the spring.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Right you are, my hearty!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I say, Jeremy, I really should advise you to think twice before you
come. A fine, upstanding young man like you should not waste his sweetness on
the desert air of Mexico, or any such place. You should go home and be admired
of the young women&mdash;they appreciate a great big chap like you&mdash;and
make a good marriage, and rear up a large family in a virtuous, respectable,
and Jones-like fashion. I am a sort of wandering comet without the shine; but,
I repeat, I see no reason why you should play tail to a second-class
comet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Married! get married! I! No, thank you, my boy. Look you, Ernest, in the
words of the prophet, &lsquo;When a wise man openeth his eye, and seeth a
thing, verily he shutteth it not up again.&rsquo; Now, I opened my eye and saw
one or two things in the course of our joint little affair&mdash;Eva, you
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest winced at the name.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I beg your pardon,&rdquo; said Jeremy, noticing it; &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t
want to allude to painful subjects, but I must to make my meaning clear. I was
very hard hit, you know, over that lady, but I stopped in time, and, not having
any imagination to speak of, did not give it rein. What is the consequence? I
have got over it; sleep well at night, have a capital appetite, and don&rsquo;t
think about her twice a week. But with you it is different. Hard hit, too,
large amount of imagination galloping about loose, so to speak&mdash;rapturous
joy, dreams of true love and perfect union of souls, which no doubt would be
well enough if the woman could put in her whack of soul, which she can&rsquo;t,
not having it to spare, but in a general way is gammon. Results, when the
burst-up comes: want of sleep, want of appetite, a desire to go
buffalo-shooting in the fever-season, and to be potted by Basutus from behind
rocks. In short, a general weariness and disgust of life&mdash;O yes, you
needn&rsquo;t deny it, I have watched you&mdash;most unwholesome state of mind.
Further results: horse-racing, a disposition to stop away from church, and nip
Cape sherry; and, worst sign of all, a leaning to ladies&rsquo; society. Being
a reasoning creature I notice this, and draw my own deductions, which amount to
the conclusion that you are in a fair way to go to the deuce, owing to trusting
your life to a woman. And the moral of all this, which I lay to heart for my
own guidance, is, never speak to a woman if you can avoid it, and when you
can&rsquo;t, let your speech be yea, yea, and nay, nay, more especially
&lsquo;nay.&rsquo; Then you stand a good chance of keeping your appetite and
peace of mind, and of making your way in the world. Marriage,
indeed!&mdash;never talk to me of marriage again;&rdquo; and Jeremy shivered at
the thought.
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed out loud at his lengthy disquisition.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And I&rsquo;ll tell you what, old fellow,&rdquo; he went on, drawing
himself up to his full height, and standing right over Ernest, so that the
latter&rsquo;s six feet looked very insignificant beside him, &ldquo;never you
speak to me about leaving you again, unless you want to put me clean out of
temper, because, look here, I don&rsquo;t like it. We have lived together since
we were twelve, or thereabouts, and, so far as I am concerned, I mean to go on
living together to the end of the chapter, or till I see I am not wanted. You
can go to Mexico, or the North Pole, or Acapulco, or wherever you like, but I
shall go too, and so that is all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you, old fellow,&rdquo; said Ernest, simply; and at that moment
their conversation was interrupted by the arrival of a Kafir messenger with a
telegram addressed to Ernest. He opened it and read it. &ldquo;Hullo,&rdquo; he
said, &ldquo;here is something better than Mexico; listen:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Alston, Pieter Maritzburg, to Kershaw, Pretoria. High
Commissioner has declared war against Cetywayo. Local cavalry urgently required
for service in Zululand. Have offered to raise a small corps of about seventy
mounted men. Offer has been accepted. Will you accept post of second in
command?&mdash;you would hold the Queen&rsquo;s commission. If so, set about
picking suitable recruits. Terms ten shillings a day, all found. Am coming up
Pretoria by this post-cart. Ask Jones if he will accept
sergeant-major-ship.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hurrah!&rdquo; sang out Ernest, with flashing eyes. &ldquo;Here is some
real service at last. Of course you will accept.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Of course,&rdquo; said Jeremy, quietly; &ldquo;but don&rsquo;t indulge
in rejoicings yet; this is going to be a big business, unless I am
mistaken.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap33"></a>CHAPTER XVII.<br/>
HANS PROPHESIES EVIL</h2>

<p>
Ernest and Jeremy did not let the grass grow under their feet. They guessed
that there would soon be a great deal of recruiting for various corps, and so
set to work at once to secure the best men. The stamp of men they aimed at
getting was the colonial-born Englishman, both because such men have more
self-respect, independence of character, and &ldquo;gumption,&rdquo; than the
ordinary drifting sediment from the fields and seaports, and also because they
were practically ready-made soldiers. They could ride as well as they could
walk, they were splendid rifle-shots, and they had, too, from childhood, been
trained in the art of travelling without baggage, and very rapidly. Ernest did
not find much difficulty in the task. Mr. Alston was well known, and had seen a
great deal of service as a young man in the Basutu wars, and stories were still
told of his nerve and pluck. He was known, too, to be a wary man, not rash or
over-confident, but of a determined mind; and, what is more, to possess a
perfect knowledge of Zulu warfare and tactics. This went a long way with
intending recruits, for the first thing a would-be colonial volunteer inquires
into is the character of his officers. He will not trust his life to men in
whom he puts no reliance. He is willing to lose it in the way of duty, but he
has a great objection to having it blundered away. Indeed, in many South
African volunteer corps it is a fundamental principle that the officers should
be elected by the men themselves. Once elected, however, they cannot be deposed
except by competent authority.
</p>

<p>
Ernest, too, was by this time well known in the Transvaal, and universally
believed in. Mr. Alston could not have chosen a better lieutenant. He was known
to have pluck and dash, and to be ready-witted in emergency; but it was not
that only which made him acceptable to the individuals whose continued
existence would very possibly depend upon his courage and discretion. Indeed,
it would be difficult to say what it was; but there are some men who are by
nature born leaders of their fellows, and who inspire confidence magnetically.
Ernest had this great gift. At first sight he was much like any other young
man, rather careless-looking than otherwise in appearance, and giving the
observer the impression that he was thinking of something else; but old hands
at native warfare, looking into his dark eyes, saw something there which told
them that this young fellow, boy as he was, comparatively speaking, would not
show himself wanting in the moment of emergency, either in courage or
discretion. Jeremy&rsquo;s nomination, too, as sergeant-major, a very important
post in such a corps, was popular enough. People had not forgotten his victory
over the Boer giant, and besides, a sergeant-major with such a physique would
have been a credit to any corps.
</p>

<p>
All these things helped to make recruiting an easy task, and when Alston and
his son Roger, weary and bruised, stepped out of the Natal post-cart four days
later, it was to be met by Ernest and Jeremy with the intelligence that his
telegram had been received, the appointments accepted, and thirty-five men
provisionally enrolled subject to his approval.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My word, young gentlemen,&rdquo; he said, highly pleased, &ldquo;you are
lieutenants worth having.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The next fortnight was a busy one for all concerned. The organisation of a
colonial volunteer corps is no joke, as anybody who has ever tried it can
testify. There were rough uniforms to be provided, arms to be obtained, and a
hundred and one other wants to be satisfied. Then came some delay about the
horses, which were to be served out by Government. At last these were handed
over, a good-looking lot, but apparently very wild. Matters were at this point,
when one day Ernest was seated in the room he used as an office in his house,
enrolling a new recruit previous to his being sworn, interviewing a tradesman
about flannel shirts, making arrangements for a supply of forage, filling up
the endless forms which the imperial authorities required for transmission to
the War Office, and a hundred other matters. Suddenly his orderly announced
that two privates of the corps wished to see him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; he asked of the orderly, testily; for he was nearly
worked to death.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A complaint, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, send them in.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The door opened, and a curious couple entered. One was a great, burly
sailor-man, who had been a quartermaster on board one of her Majesty&rsquo;s
ships at Cape Town, got drunk, overstayed his leave, and deserted rather than
face the punishment; the other a quick, active little fellow, with a face like
a ferret. He was a Zululand trader, who had ruined himself by drink, and a
peculiarly valuable member of the corps on account of his knowledge of the
country in which they were going to serve. Both the men saluted and stood at
ease.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my men, what is it?&rdquo; asked Ernest, going on filling up his
forms.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing, so far as I am concerned, sir,&rdquo; said the little man.
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked up sharply at the quondam tar.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Adam, your complaint; I have no time to waste.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Adam hitched up his breeches and began:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see, sir, I brought <i>he</i> here by the scruff of the neck.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s true, sir,&rdquo; said the little man, rubbing that portion
of his body.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because he and I, sir, as is messmates, sir, &rsquo;ad a difference of
opinion. It was his day, you see, sir, to cook for our mess, and instead of
putting on the pot, sir, he comes to me he does, and he says &lsquo;Adam, you
blooming father of a race of fools&rsquo;&mdash;that&rsquo;s what he says, sir,
a-comparing of me to the gent who lived in a garden&mdash;&lsquo;why
don&rsquo;t you come and take the &mdash;&mdash; skins off the &mdash;&mdash; taters, instead of
a-squatting of yourself down on that there &mdash;&mdash; bed!&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Slightly in error, sir,&rdquo; broke in the little man, suavely;
&ldquo;our big friend&rsquo;s memory is not as substantial as his form. What I
said was, &lsquo;My <i>dear</i> Adam, as I see you have nothing to occupy your
time, except sit and play a jew&rsquo;s-harp upon your <i>couch,</i> would you
be so kind as to come and assist me to remove the outer integument of these
potatoes?&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest began to explode, but checked himself, and said sternly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t talk nonsense, Adam; tell me your complaint.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, sir,&rdquo; answered the big sailor, scratching his head,
&ldquo;if I must give it a name, it is this&mdash;this here man, sir, be too
<i>infarnal sargustic</i>.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Be off with you both,&rdquo; said Ernest, sternly, &ldquo;and
don&rsquo;t trouble me with any such nonsense again, or I will put you both
under arrest, and stop your pay. Come, march!&rdquo; and he pointed to the
door. As he did so he observed a Boer gallop swiftly past the house, and take
the turn to Government House.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is up now?&rdquo; he wondered.
</p>

<p>
Half an hour afterwards another man passed the window, also at full gallop, and
also turned up towards Government House. Another half-hour passed, and Mr.
Alston came hurrying in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Ernest,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;here is a pretty business.
Three men have come in to report that Cetewayo has sent an Impi (army) round by
the back of Secocoeni&rsquo;s country to burn Pretoria, and return to Zululand
across the High Veldt. They say that the Impi is now resting in the Saltpan
Bush, about twenty miles off, and will attack the town to-night or to-morrow
night. All these three, who have, by the way, had no communication with each
other, state that they have actually seen the captains of the Impi, who came to
tell them to bid the other Dutchmen stand aside, as they are now fighting the
Queen, and they would not be hurt.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It seems incredible,&rdquo; said Ernest; &ldquo;do you believe
it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. It is possible, and the evidence is strong. It is
possible; I have known the Zulus make longer marches than that. The Governor
has ordered me to gallop to the spot, and report if I can see anything of this
Impi.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Am I to go too?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, you will remain in the corps. I take Roger with me&mdash;he is a
light weight&mdash;and two spare horses. If there should be an attack and I
should not be back, or if anything should happen, you will do your duty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good-bye. I am off. You had better muster the men to be ready for an
emergency;&rdquo; and he was gone.
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes afterwards, down came an orderly from the officer commanding, with
a peremptory order to the effect that the officer commanding Alston&rsquo;s
Horse was to mount and parade his men in readiness for immediate service.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here is a pretty go,&rdquo; thought Ernest, &ldquo;and the horses not
served out yet!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then Jeremy came in, saluted, and informed him that the men were mustered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Serve out the saddlery. Let every man shoulder his saddle. Tell Mazooku
to bring out the &lsquo;Devil&rsquo; (Ernest&rsquo;s favourite horse), and
march the men up to the Government stables. I will be with you
presently.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy saluted again with much ceremony and vanished. He was the most
punctilious sergeant-major who ever breathed.
</p>

<p>
Twenty minutes later, a long file of men, each with a carbine slung to his
back, and a saddle on his head, which, at a distance, gave them the appearance
of a string of gigantic mushrooms, were to be seen proceeding towards the
Government stables a mile away.
</p>

<p>
Ernest, mounted on his great black stallion, and looking, in his military
uniform and the revolver slung across his shoulders, a typical volunteer
officer, was there before them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, my men,&rdquo; he said, as soon as they were paraded, &ldquo;go in,
and each man choose the horse which he likes best, bridle him, and bring him
out and saddle him. Sharp!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The men broke their ranks and rushed to the stables, each anxious to secure a
better horse than his neighbours. Presently from the stables there arose a
sound of kicking, plunging, and &ldquo;wo-hoing&rdquo; impossible to describe.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There will be a pretty scene soon, with these unbroken brutes,&rdquo;
thought Ernest.
</p>

<p>
He was not destined to be disappointed. The horses were dragged out, most of
them lying back upon their haunches, kicking, bucking, and going through every
other equine antic.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Saddle up!&rdquo; shouted Ernest, as soon as they were all out.
</p>

<p>
It was done with great difficulty.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now mount.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Sixty men lifted their legs and swung themselves into the saddle, not without
sad misgivings. A few seconds passed, and at least twenty of them were on the
broad of their backs; one or two were being dragged by the stirrup-leather; a
few were clinging to their bucking and plunging steeds; and the remainder of
Alston&rsquo;s Horse was scouring the plain in every possible direction. Never
was there such a scene.
</p>

<p>
In time, however, most of the men got back again, and some sort of order was
restored. Several men were hurt, one or two badly. These were sent to the
hospital, and Ernest formed the rest into half-sections, to be marched to the
place of rendezvous. Just then, to make matters better, down came the rain in
sheets, soaking them to the skin, and making confusion worse confounded. So
they rode to the town, which was by this time in an extraordinary state of
panic. All business was suspended; women were standing about on the verandahs,
hugging their babies and crying, or making preparations to go into laager; men
were hiding deeds and valuables, or hurrying to defence meetings on the
market-square, where the Government were serving out rifles and ammunition to
all able-bodied citizens; frightened mobs of Basutos and Christian Kafirs were
jabbering in the streets, and telling tales of the completeness of Zulu
slaughter, or else running from the city to pass the night among the hills.
Altogether the scene was most curious, till dense darkness came down over it
like an extinguisher, and put it out.
</p>

<p>
Ernest took his men to a building which the Government had placed at their
disposal, and had the horses stabled, but not unsaddled. Presently orders came
down to him to keep the corps under arms all night; to send out four patrols,
to be relieved at midnight, to watch the approaches to the town; and at dawn to
saddle up and reconnoitre the neighbouring country.
</p>

<p>
Ernest obeyed these orders as well as he could; that is, he sent the patrols
out, but so dense was the darkness that they never got back again till the
following morning, when they were collected, and, in one instance, dug out of
the various ditches, quarry-holes, &amp;c., into which they had fallen.
</p>

<p>
About eleven o&rsquo;clock Ernest was seated in a little room that opened out
of the main building where they were quartered, consulting with Jeremy about
matters connected with the corps, and wondering if Alston had found a Zulu
Impi, or if it was all gammon when suddenly they heard the sharp challenge of
the sentry outside:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Who goes there?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Whoever it is had better answer sharp,&rdquo; said Ernest; &ldquo;I gave
the sentry orders to be quick with his rifle to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Bang!&mdash;crash! followed by loud howls of &ldquo;Wilhelmina, my wife! Ah,
the cruel man has killed my Wilhelmina!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Heavens, it is that lunatic German! Here, orderly, run up to the Defence
Committee and the Government offices, and tell them that it is nothing; they
will think the Zulus are here. Tell two men to bring the man in here, and to
stop his howls.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Presently Ernest&rsquo;s old friend of the High Veldt, looking very wild and
uncouth in the lamplight, with his long beard and matted hair, from which the
rain was dripping, was bundled rather unceremoniously into the room.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, there you are, dear sir; it is two&mdash;three years since we meet.
I look for you everywhere, and they tell me you are here, and I come on quick
all through the dark and the rain; and then before I know if I am on my head or
my heel, the cruel man he ups a rifle, and do shoot my Wilhelmina, and make a
great hole through her poor stomach. O sir, wat shall I do?&rdquo; and the
great child began to shed tears; &ldquo;you, too, will weep: you, too, love my
Wilhelmina, and sleep with her one night&mdash;bo-hoo!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;For goodness&rsquo; sake, stop that nonsense! This is no time or place
for such fooling.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He spoke sharply, and the monomaniac pulled up, only giving vent to an
occasional sob.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, what is your business with me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The German&rsquo;s face changed from its expression of idiotic grief to one of
refined intelligence. He glanced towards Jeremy, who was exploding in the
corner.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You can speak before this gentleman, Hans,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir, I am going to say a strange thing to you this night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He was speaking quite quietly and composedly now, and might have been mistaken
for a sane man.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir, I hear that you go down to Zululand to help to fight the fierce
Zulus. When I hear it, I was far away, but something come into my head to
travel as quick as Wilhelmina can, and come and tell you not to go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How can I say what I do mean? This I know&mdash;many shall go down to
Zululand who rest in this house to-night, few shall come back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You mean that I shall be killed?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know not. There are things as bad as death, and yet not death.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He covered his eyes with his hand, and continued:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I cannot <i>see</i> you dead, but do not go; I pray you do not
go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My good Hans, what is the good of coming to me with such an old
wives&rsquo; tale? Even if it were true, and I knew that I must be killed
twenty times, I should go. I cannot run away from my duty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is spoken as a brave man should,&rdquo; answered his visitor, in
his native tongue. &ldquo;I have done <i>my</i> duty, and told you what Wilhelmina
said. Now go, and when the black men are leaping up at you like the sea-waves
round a rock, may the God of Rest guide your hand, and bring you safe from the
slaughter!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest gazed at the old man&rsquo;s pale face; it wore a curious rapt
expression, and the eyes were looking upwards.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps, old friend,&rdquo; he said, addressing him in German, &ldquo;I,
as well as you, have a City of Rest which I would reach, and care not if I pass
thither on an assegai.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I know it,&rdquo; replied Hans, in the same tongue; &ldquo;but useless
is it to seek rest till God gives it. You have sought and passed through the
jaws of many deaths, but you have not found. If it be not God&rsquo;s will, you
will not find it now. I know you too seek rest, my brother, and had I known
that you would find that only down there&rdquo;&mdash;and he pointed towards
Zululand&mdash;&ldquo;I had not come down to warn you, for blessed is rest, and
happy he who gains it. But no, it is not that; I am sure now that you will not
die; your evil, whatever it is, will fall from heaven.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So be it,&rdquo; said Ernest; &ldquo;you are a strange man. I thought
you a common monomaniac, and now you speak like a prophet.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are right; I am both. Mostly I am mad. I know it. But sometimes my
madness has its moments of inspiration, when the clouds lift from my mind, and
I see things none others can see, and hear voices to which your ears are deaf.
Such a moment is on me now; soon I shall be mad again. But before the cloud
settles I would speak to you. Why, I know not, save that I loved you when first
I saw your eyes open there upon the cold veldt. Presently I must go, and we
shall meet no more, for I draw near to the snow-clad tree that marks the gate
of the City of Rest. I can look into your heart now and see the trouble in it,
and the sad, beautiful face that is printed on your mind. Ah, she is not happy;
she, too, must work out her rest. But the time is short, the cloud settles, and
I would tell you what is in my mind. Even though trouble, great trouble, close
you in, do not be cast down, for trouble is the key of heaven. Be good; turn to
the God you have neglected; struggle against the snares of the senses. O, I can
see now! For you and for all you love there is joy and there is peace!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Suddenly he broke off; the look of inspiration faded from his face, which grew
stupid and wild-looking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, the cruel man; he made a great hole in the stomach of my
Wilhelmina!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest had been bending forwards, listening with parted lips to the old
man&rsquo;s talk. When he saw that the inspiration had left him, he raised his
head and said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Gather yourself together, I beg you, for a moment. I wish to ask one
question. Shall I ever&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How shall I stop de bleeding from the witals of my dear wife?&mdash;who
will plug up the hole in her?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest gazed at the man. Was he putting all this on?&mdash;or was he really
mad? For the life of him he could not tell.
</p>

<p>
Taking out a sovereign, he gave it to him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is money to doctor Wilhelmina with,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Would
you like to sleep here?&mdash;I can give you a blanket.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man took the money without hesitation, and thanked Ernest for it, but
said he must go on at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where are you going to?&rdquo; asked Jeremy, who had been watching him
with great curiosity, but had not understood that part of the conversation
which had been carried on in German.
</p>

<p>
Hans turned upon him with a quick look of suspicion.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rustenburg&rdquo; (<i>Anglicè;,</i> the town of rest), he answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! the road is bad, and it is far to travel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he replied, &ldquo;the road is rough and long.
Farewell!&rdquo; And he was gone.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, he is a curious old buster, and no mistake, with his cheerful
anticipations and his Wilhelmina,&rdquo; reflected Jeremy, aloud. &ldquo;Just
fancy starting for Rustenburg at this hour of the night, too! Why it is a
hundred miles off!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest only smiled. He knew that it was no earthly Rustenburg that the old man
sought.
</p>

<p>
Some while afterwards he heard that Hans had attained the rest which he
desired. Wilhelmina got fixed in a snowdrift in a pass of the Drakensberg. He
was unable to drag her out.
</p>

<p>
So he crept underneath and fell asleep, and the snow came down and covered
them.

MR. ALSTON&rsquo;S VIEWS</h2>

<p>
The Zulu attack on Pretoria ultimately turned out only to have existed in the
minds of two mad Kafirs, who dressed themselves up after the fashion of chiefs,
and personating two Zulu nobles of repute, who were known to be in the command
of regiments, rode from house to house, telling the Dutch inhabitants that they
had an Impi of thirty thousand men lying in the bush, and bidding them stand
aside while they destroyed the Englishmen. Hence the scare.
</p>

<p>
The next month was a busy one for Alston&rsquo;s Horse. It was drill, drill,
drill, morning, noon, and night. But the results soon became apparent. In three
weeks from the day they got their horses, there was not a smarter, quicker
corps in South Africa, and Mr. Alston and Ernest were highly complimented on
the soldier-like appearance of the men, and the rapidity and exactitude with
which they executed all the ordinary cavalry manoeuvres.
</p>

<p>
They were to march from Pretoria on the 10th of January, and expected to
overtake Colonel Glynn&rsquo;s column, with which was the General, about the
18th, by which time Mr. Alston calculated the real advance upon Zululand would
begin.
</p>

<p>
On the 8th, the good people of Pretoria gave the corps a farewell banquet, for
most of its members were Pretoria men; and colonists are never behindhand when
there is an excuse for conviviality and good-fellowship.
</p>

<p>
Of course, after the banquet, Mr.&mdash;or, as he was now called,
Captain&mdash;Alston&rsquo;s health was drunk. But Alston was a man of few
words, and had a horror of speech-making.
</p>

<p>
He contented himself with a few brief sentences of acknowledgment, and sat
down. Then somebody proposed the health of the other commissioned and
noncommissioned officers, and to this Ernest rose to respond, making a very
good speech in reply. He rapidly sketched the state of political affairs, of
which the Zulu war was the outcome, and, without expressing any opinion on the
justice or wisdom of that war, of which, to speak the truth, he had grave
doubts, he went on to show, in a few well-chosen, weighty words, how vital were
the interests involved in its successful conclusion, now that it once had been
undertaken. Finally he concluded thus:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am well aware, gentlemen, that with many of those who are your guests
here to-night, and my own comrades, this state of affairs and the conviction of
the extreme urgency of the occasion has been the cause of their enlistment. It
is impossible for me to look down these tables, and see so many in our
rough-and-ready uniform, whom I have known in other walks of life, as farmers,
storekeepers, Government clerks, and what not, without realising most clearly
the extreme necessity that can have brought these peaceable citizens together
on such an errand as we are bent on. Certainly it is not the ten shillings a
day, or the mere excitement of savage warfare, that has done this&rdquo; (cries
of &lsquo;No, no!&rsquo;);&rdquo; because most of them can well afford to
despise the money, and many more have seen enough of native war, and know well
that few rewards and plenty of hard work fall to the lot of colonial
volunteers. Then what is it? I will venture a reply. It is that sense of
patriotism which is a part and parcel of the English mind&rdquo; (cheers),
&ldquo;and which from generation to generation has been the root of
England&rsquo;s greatness, and, so long as the British blood remains untainted,
will from unborn generation to generation be the mainspring of the greatness
that is yet to be of those wider Englands, of which I hope this continent will
become not the least.&rdquo; (Loud cheers.)
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That, gentlemen and men of Alston&rsquo;s Horse, is the bond which
unites us together; it is the sense of a common duty to perform, of a common
danger to combat, of a common patriotism to vindicate. And for that reason,
because of the patriotism and the duty, I feel sure that when the end of this
campaign comes, whatever that end may be, no one, be he imperial officer, or
newspaper correspondent, or Zulu foe, will be able to say that Alston&rsquo;s
Horse shirked its work, or was mutinous, or proved a broken reed, piercing the
side of those who leaned on it.&rdquo; (Cheers.) &ldquo;I feel sure, too, that,
though there may be a record of brave deeds such as become brave men, there
will be none of a comrade deserted in the time of need, or of a failure in the
moment of emergency, however terrible that emergency may be.&rdquo; (Cheers.)
&ldquo;Ay, my brethren in arms,&rdquo; and here Ernest&rsquo;s eyes flashed and
his strong clear voice went ringing down the great hall, &ldquo;whom England
has called, and who have not failed to answer to the call, I repeat, however
terrible may be that emergency, even if it should involve the certainty of
death&mdash;I speak thus because I feel I am addressing brave men, who do not
fear to die, when death means duty, and life means dishonour&mdash;I know well
that you will rise to it, and, falling shoulder to shoulder, will pass as
heroes should on to the land of shades&mdash;on to that Valhalla of which no
true heart should fear to set foot upon the threshold.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest sat down amid ringing cheers. Nor did these noble words, coming as they
did straight from the loyal heart of an English gentleman, fail of their
effect. On the contrary, when, a fortnight later, Alston&rsquo;s Horse formed
that fatal ring on Isandhlwana&rsquo;s bloody field, they flashed through the
brain of more than one despairing man, so that he set his teeth and died the
harder for them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bravo, my young Viking!&rdquo; said Mr. Alston to Ernest, while the roof
was still echoing to the cheers evoked by his speech, &ldquo;the old Bersekir
spirit is cropping up, eh?&rdquo; He knew that Ernest&rsquo;s mother&rsquo;s
family, like so many of the old Eastern County stocks, were of Danish
extraction.
</p>

<p>
It was a great night for Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Two days later Alston&rsquo;s Horse, sixty-four strong, marched out of Pretoria
with a military band playing before. Alas! they never marched back again.
</p>

<p>
At the neck of the poort or pass the band and the crowd of ladies and gentlemen
who had accompanied them halted, and, having given them three cheers, turned
and left them. Ernest, too, turned and gazed at the pretty town, with its white
houses and rose-hedges red with bloom, nestling on the plain beneath, and
wondered if he would ever see it again. He never did.
</p>

<p>
The troop was then ordered to march at ease in half-sections, and Ernest rode
up to the side of Alston; on his other side was the boy Roger, now about
fourteen years of age, who acted as Alston&rsquo;s aide-de-camp, and was in
high spirits at the prospect of the coming campaign. Presently Alston sent his
son back to the other end of the line on some errand.
</p>

<p>
Ernest watched him as he galloped off, and a thought struck him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Alston,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;do you think that it is wise to bring
that boy into this business?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His friend slewed himself round sharply in the saddle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why not?&rdquo; he asked, in his deliberate way.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, you know there is a risk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And why should not the boy run risks as well as the rest of us? Look
here, Ernest, when I first met you there in Guernsey I was going to see the
place where my wife was brought up. Do you know how she died?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have heard she died a violent death; I do not know how.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then I will tell you, though it costs me something to speak of it. She
died by a Zulu assegai, a week after the boy was born. She saved his life by
hiding him under a heap of straw. Don&rsquo;t ask me particulars; I can&rsquo;t
bear to talk of it. Perhaps now you understand why I am commanding a corps
enrolled to serve against the Zulus. Perhaps, too, you will understand why the
lad is with me. We go to avenge my wife and his mother, or to fall in the
attempt. I have waited long for the opportunity; it has come.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest relapsed into silence, and presently fell back to his troop.
</p>

<p>
On the 20th of January, Alston&rsquo;s Horse, having moved down by easy marches
from Pretoria, camped at Rorke&rsquo;s Drift, on the Bulialo River, not far
from a store and a thatched building used as a hospital, which were destined to
become historical. Here orders reached them to march on the following day and
join No. 3 column, with which was Lord Chelmsford himself, and which was camped
about nine miles from the Bulialo River, at a spot called Isandhlwana, or the
&ldquo;Place of the Little Hand.&rdquo; Next day, the 21st of January, the
corps moved on accordingly, and following the waggon-track that runs past the
Inhlazatye Mountain, by midday came up to the camp, where about twenty-five
hundred men of all arms were assembled under the immediate command of Colonel
Glynn. Their camp, which was about eight hundred yards square, was pitched
facing a wide plain, with its back towards a precipitous, slab-sided hill, of
the curious formation sometimes to be seen in South Africa. This was
Isandhlwana.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hullo!&rdquo; said Alston, as, on reaching the summit of the neck over
which the waggon-road runs, they came in sight of the camp, &ldquo;they are not
entrenched. By Jove,&rdquo; he added, after scanning the camp carefully,
&ldquo;they haven&rsquo;t even got a waggon-laager!&rdquo; and he whistled
expressively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Alston so rarely showed surprise that he knew there must be something very
wrong.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean, Ernest, that there is nothing to prevent this camp from being
destroyed, and every soul in it, by a couple of Zulu regiments, if they choose
to make a night attack. How are they to be kept out, I should like to know, in
the dark, when you can&rsquo;t see to shoot them, unless there is some barrier?
These officers, fresh from home, don&rsquo;t know what a Zulu charge is, that
is very clear. I only hope they won&rsquo;t have occasion to find out. Look
there,&rdquo; and he pointed to a waggon lumbering along before them, on the
top of which, among a lot of other miscellaneous articles, lay a bundle of
cricketing bats and wickets, &ldquo;they think that they are going on a picnic.
What is the use, too, I should like to know, of sending four feeble columns
sprawling over Zululand, to run the risk of being crushed in detail by a foe
that can move from point to point at the rate of fifty miles a day, and which
can at any moment slip past them and turn Natal into a howling wilderness?
There, it is no use grumbling; I only hope I may be wrong. Get back to your
troop, Ernest, and let us come into camp smartly. Form fours&mdash;trot!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On arrival in the camp, Mr. Alston learned, on reporting himself to the officer
commanding, that two strong parties of mounted men under the command of Major
Dartnell were out on a reconnaissance towards the Inhlazatye Mountain, in which
direction the Zulus were supposed to be in force. The orders he received were
to rest his horses, as he might be required to join the mounted force with
Major Dartnell on the morrow.
</p>

<p>
That night, as Alston and Ernest stood together at the door of their tent,
smoking a pipe before turning in, they had some conversation. It was a
beautiful night, and the stars shone brightly. Ernest looked at them, and
thought on how many of man&rsquo;s wars those stars had looked.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Star-gazing?&rdquo; asked Mr. Alston.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was contemplating our future homes,&rdquo; said Ernest, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you believe that, do you? think you are immortal, and that sort of
thing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; I believe that we shall live many lives, and that some of them will
be there,&rdquo; and he pointed to the stars. &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know. I think it rather presumptuous. Why should you
suppose that for you is reserved a bright destiny among the stars more than for
these?&rdquo; and he put out his hand and clasped several of a swarm of
flying-ants which were passing at the time. Just think how small must be the
difference between these ants and us in the eyes of a Power who can produce
both. The same breath of life animates both. These have their homes, their
government, their colonies, their drones and workers. They enslave and annex,
lay up riches, and, to bring the argument to an appropriate conclusion, make
peace and war. What then is the difference? We are bigger, walk on two legs,
have a larger capacity for suffering, and, we believe, a soul. Is it so great
that we should suppose that for us is reserved a heaven, or all the glorious
worlds which people space&mdash;for these, annihilation? Perhaps we are at the
top of the tree of development, and for them may be the future, for us the
annihilation. Who knows? There, fly away, and make the most of the present, for
nothing else is certain.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You overlook religion entirely.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Religion? Which religion? There are so many. Our Christian God, Buddha,
Mohammed, Brahma, all number their countless millions of worshippers. Each
promises a different thing, each commands the equally intense belief of his
worshippers, for with them all blind faith is a condition precedent; and each
appears to satisfy their spiritual aspirations. Can all of these be true
religions? Each holds the other false and outside the pale; each tries to
convert the other, and fails. There are many lesser ones of which the same
thing may be said.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But the same spirit underlies them all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps. There is much that is noble in all religions, but there is also
much that is terrible. To the actual horrors and wearing anxieties of physical
existence, religion bids us add on the vaguer horrors of a spiritual existence,
which are to be absolutely endless. The average Christian would be
uncomfortable if you deprived him of his hell and his personal devil. For
myself, I decline to believe in such things. If there is a hell, it is this
world; this world is the place of expiation for the sins of the world, and the
only real devil is the devil of man&rsquo;s evil passions.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is possible to be religious and be a good man without believing in
hell,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I think so, otherwise my chance is a poor one. Besides, I do not
deny the Almighty Power. I only deny the cruelty that is attributed to Him. It
may be that, from the accumulated mass of the wrong and bloodshed and agony of
this hard world, that Power is building up some high purpose. Out of the bodies
of millions of living creatures Nature worked out her purpose and made the
rocks, but the process must have been unpleasant to the living creatures by
whose humble means the great strata were reared up. They lived, to die in
billions, that tens of thousands of years afterwards there might be a rock. It
may be so with us. Our tears and blood and agony may produce some solid end
that now we cannot guess; their volume, which cannot be wasted, for nothing is
wasted, may be building up one of the rocks of God&rsquo;s far-off purpose. But
that we shall be tortured here for a time in order that we may be indefinitely
tortured there and he pointed to the stars, &ldquo;that I will never believe.
Look at the mist rising from that hollow; so does the reek of the world&rsquo;s
misery rise as an offering to the world&rsquo;s gods. The mist will cease to
rise, and fall again in rain, and bring a blessing; but the incense of human
suffering rises night and day for so long as the earth shall endure, nor does
it fall again in dews of mercy. And yet Christians, who declare that God is
love, declare, too, that for the vast majority of their fellow-creatures this
process is to continue from millennium to millennium.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It depends on our life, they say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, Ernest, a man can do no more than he can. When I got to the
age of discretion, which I put at eight-and-twenty&mdash;you have hardly
reached it yet, my boy, you are nothing but a babe&mdash;I made three
resolutions: always to try and do my duty, never to turn my back on a poor man
or a friend in trouble, and, if possible, not to make love to my
neighbour&rsquo;s wife. Those resolutions I have often broken more or less,
either in the spirit or the letter, but in the main I have stuck to them, and I
can put my hand upon my heart to-night and say, &lsquo;I have done my
best!&rsquo; And so I go my path, turning neither to the right nor to the left,
and when Fate finds me, I shall meet him, fearing nothing, for I know he has
wreaked his worst upon me, and can only at the utmost bring me eternal sleep;
and hoping nothing, because my experience here has not been such as to justify
the hope of any happiness for man, and my vanity is not sufficiently strong to
allow me to believe in the intervention of a superior Power to save so
miserable a creature from the common lot of life. Good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
On the following day his fate found him.

<h2><a name="chap35"></a>CHAPTER XIX.<br/>
ISANDHLWANA</h2>

<p>
Midnight came, and the camp was sunk in sleep. Up to the sky, whither it was
decreed their spirits should pass before the dark closed in again and hid their
mangled corpses, floated the faint breath of some fourteen hundred men. There
they lay, sleeping the healthy sleep of vigorous manhood, their brains busy
with the fantastic madness of a hundred dreams, and little recking of the
inevitable morrow. There, in his sleep, the white man saw his native village,
with its tall, wind-swayed elms, and the gray old church that for centuries had
watched the last slumber of his race; the Kafir, the sunny slope of fair Natal,
with the bright light dancing on his cattle&rsquo;s horns, and the green of the
gardens, where, for his well-being, his wives and children toiled. To some that
night came dreams of high ambition, of brave adventure, crowned with the
perfect triumph we never reach; to some, visions of beloved faces, long since
passed away; to some, the reflected light of a far-off home, and echoes of the
happy laughter of little children. And so their lamps wavered hither and
thither in the spiritual breath of sleep, flickering wildly, ere they went out
for ever. The night-wind swept in sad gusts across Isandhlwana&rsquo;s plain,
tossing the green grass, which to-morrow would be red. It moaned against
Inhlazatye&rsquo;s Mountain and died upon Upindo, fanning the dark faces of a
host of warriors who rested there upon their spears, sharpened for the coming
slaughter. And as it breathed upon them, they turned, those brave soldiers of
U&rsquo;Cetywayo&mdash;&ldquo;born to be killed,&rdquo; as their saying runs,
at Cetywayo&rsquo;s bidding&mdash;and, grasping their assegais, raised
themselves to listen. It was nothing, death was not yet; death for the morrow,
sleep for the night.
</p>

<p>
A little after one o&rsquo;clock on the morning of the 22nd of January, Ernest
was roused by the sound of a horse&rsquo;s hoofs and the harsh challenge of the
sentries. &ldquo;Despatch from Major Dartnell,&rdquo; was the answer, and the
messenger passed on. Half an hour more and the reveille was sounded, and the
camp hummed in the darkness like a hive of bees making ready for the dawn.
</p>

<p>
Soon it was known that the General and Colonel Glynn were about to move out to
the support of Major Dartnell, who reported a large force of the enemy in front
of him, with six companies of the second battalion of the 24th Regiment, four
guns, and the mounted infantry.
</p>

<p>
At dawn they left.
</p>

<p>
At eight o&rsquo;clock a report arrived from a picket, stationed about a mile
away on a hill to the north of the camp, that a body of Zulus was approaching
from the north-east.
</p>

<p>
At nine o&rsquo;clock the enemy showed over the crest of the hills for a few
minutes, and then disappeared.
</p>

<p>
At ten o&rsquo;clock Colonel Durnford arrived from Rorke&rsquo;s Drift with a
rocket battery and two hundred and fifty mounted native soldiers, and took over
the command of the camp from Colonel Pulleine. As he came up he stopped for a
minute to speak to Alston, whom he knew, and Ernest noticed him. He was a
handsome, soldier-like man, with his arm in a sling, a long, fair moustache,
and restless, anxious expression of face.
</p>

<p>
At 10.30, Colonel Durnford&rsquo;s force, divided into two portions, was, with
the rocket battery, pushed some miles forwards to ascertain the enemy&rsquo;s
movements, and a company of the 24th was directed to take up a position on the
hill about a mile to the north of the camp. Meanwhile, the enemy, which they
afterwards heard consisted of the Undi Corps, the Nokenke and Umcitu Regiments,
and the Nkobamakosi and Imbonambi Regiments, in all about twenty thousand men,
were resting about two miles from Isandhlwana, with no intention of attacking
that day. They had not yet been &ldquo;moutied&rdquo; (doctored), and the
condition of the moon was not propitious.
</p>

<p>
Unfortunately, however, Colonel Durnford&rsquo;s mounted Basutos, in pushing
forwards, came upon a portion of the Umcitu Regiment, and fired on it;
whereupon the Umcitu came into action, driving Durnford&rsquo;s Horse before
them, and then engaged the company of the 24th, which had been stationed on the
hill to the north of the camp, and, after a stubborn resistance, annihilating
it. It was followed by the Nokenke, Imbonambi, and Nkobamakosi Regiments, who
executed a flanking movement, and threatened the front of the camp. For awhile
the Undi Corps, which formed the chest of the army, held its ground. Then it
marched off to the right, and directed its course to the north of Isandhlwana
Mountain, with the object of turning the position.
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile, the remaining companies of the 24th were advanced to various
positions in front of the camp, and engaged the enemy, for awhile holding him
in check; the two guns under Major Smith shelling the Nokenke Regiment, which
formed the Zulu left centre, with great effect. The shells could be seen
bursting amid the dense masses of Zulus, who were coming on slowly and in
perfect silence, making large gaps in their ranks, which instantly closed up
over the dead.
</p>

<p>
At this point the advance of the Undi Regiment to the Zulu right and the
English left was reported; and Alston&rsquo;s Horse were ordered to proceed,
and, if possible, to check it. Accordingly they left, and, riding behind the
company of the 24th on the hill, to the north of the camp, which was now hotly
engaged with the Umcitu, and Durnford&rsquo;s Basutos, who, fighting
splendidly, were slowly being pushed back, made for the north side of
Isandhlwana. As soon as they got on to the high ground they caught sight of the
Undi, who, something over three thousand strong, were running swiftly in a
formation of companies, about half a mile away to the northward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Heaven, they mean to turn the mountain, and seize the
waggon-road!&rdquo; said Mr. Alston. &ldquo;Gallop!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The troop dashed down the slope towards a pass in a stony ridge, which would
command the path of the Undi, as they did so breaking through and killing two
or three of a thin line of Zulus that formed the extreme point of one of the
horns or nippers, by means of which the enemy intended to enclose the camp and
crush it.
</p>

<p>
After this, Alston&rsquo;s Horse saw nothing more of the general fight; but it
may be as well to briefly relate what happened. The Zulus of the various
regiments pushed slowly on towards the camp, notwithstanding their heavy
losses. Their object was to give time to the horns or nippers to close round
it. Meanwhile, those in command realised too late the extreme seriousness of
the position, and began to concentrate the various companies. Too late! The
enemy saw that the nippers had closed. He knew, too, that the Undi could not be
far off the waggon-road, the only way of retreat; and so, abandoning his
silence and his slow advance, he raised the Zulu war-shout, and charged in from
a distance of from six to eight hundred yards.
</p>

<p>
Up to this time the English loss had been small, for the shooting of the Zulus
was vile. The enemy, on the contrary, had, especially during the last half-hour
before they charged, lost heavily. But now the tables turned. First the Natal
Contingent, seeing that they were surrounded, bolted, and laid open the right
and rear flank of the troops. In poured the Zulus, so that most of the soldiers
had not even time to fix bayonets. In another minute, our men were being
assegaied right and left, and the retreat on the camp had become a fearful
rout. But even then there was nowhere to run to. The Undi Corps (which
afterwards passed on and attacked the post at Rorke&rsquo;s Drift) already held
the waggon-road, and the only practical way of retreat was down a gully to the
south of the road. Into this the broken fragments of the force plunged wildly,
and after them and mixed up with them went their Zulu foes, massacring every
living thing they came across.
</p>

<p>
So the camp was cleared. When, a couple of hours afterwards, Commandant
Lonsdale, of Lonsdale&rsquo;s Horse, was sent back by General Chelmsford to
ascertain what the firing was about, he could see nothing wrong. The tents were
standing, the waggons were there; there were even soldiers moving about. It did
not occur to him that it was the soldiers&rsquo; coats which were moving on the
backs of Kafirs, and that the soldiers themselves would never move again. So he
rode quickly up to the headquarter tents; out of which, to his surprise, there
suddenly stalked a huge naked Zulu, smeared all over with blood, and waving in
his hand a bloody assegai.
</p>

<p>
Having seen enough, he then rode back again to tell the General that his camp
was taken.
</p>

<p>
To God&rsquo;s good providence and Cetywayo&rsquo;s clemency, rather than to
our own wisdom, do we owe it that all the outlying homesteads in Natal were not
laid in ashes, and men, women, and children put to the assegai.
</p>

<h2><a name="chap36"></a>CHAPTER XX.<br/>
THE END OF ALSTON&rsquo;S HORSE</h2>

<p>
Alston&rsquo;s Horse soon reached the ridge, past which the Undi were
commencing to run, at a distance of about three hundred and fifty yards, and
the order was given to dismount and line it. This they did, one man in every
four keeping a few paces back to hold the horses of his section. Then they
opened fire; and next second came back the sound of the thudding of the bullets
on the shields and bodies of the Zulu warriors.
</p>

<p>
Ernest, seated up high on his great black horse &ldquo;The Devil,&rdquo; for
the officers did not dismount, could see how terrible was the effect of that
raking fire, delivered as it was, not by raw English boys, who scarcely knew
one end of a rifle from the other, but by men, all of whom could shoot, and
many of whom were crack shots. All along the line of the Undi companies men
threw up their arms and dropped dead, or staggered out of the ranks wounded.
But the main body never paused. By-and-by they would come back and move the
wounded, or kill them if they were not likely to recover.
</p>

<p>
Soon, as the range got longer, the fire began to be less deadly, and Ernest
could see that fewer men were dropping.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; said Alston, galloping up to him, &ldquo;I am going to
charge them. Look, they will soon cross the donga, and reach the slopes of the
mountain, and we sha&rsquo;n&rsquo;t be able to follow them on the broken
ground.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Isn&rsquo;t it rather risky?&rdquo; asked Ernest, somewhat dismayed at
the idea of launching their little clump of mounted men at the moving mass
before them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Risky? yes, of course it is, but my orders were to delay the enemy as
much as possible, and the horses are fresh. But, my lad&rdquo;&mdash;and he
bent towards him and spoke low&mdash;&ldquo;it doesn&rsquo;t much matter
whether we are killed charging or running away. I am sure that the camp must be
taken; there is no hope. Good-bye, Ernest; if I fall, fight the corps as long
as possible, and kill as many of those devils as you can; and if you survive,
remember to make off well to the left. The regiments will have passed by then.
God bless you, my boy! Now order the bugler to sound the &lsquo;cease
fire,&rsquo; and let the men mount.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were the last words Alston ever spoke to him, and Ernest often remembered,
with affectionate admiration, that even at that moment he thought more of his
friend&rsquo;s safety than he did of his own. As to their tenor, Ernest had
already suspected the truth, though, luckily, the suspicion had not as yet
impregnated the corps. Mazooku, too, who as usual was with him, mounted on a
Basutu pony, had just informed him that, in his (Mazooku&rsquo;s) opinion, they
were all as good as ripped up (alluding to the Zulu habit of cutting a dead
enemy open), and adding a consolatory remark to the effect that man can die but
once, and &ldquo;good job too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But, strangely enough, he did not feel afraid; indeed, he never felt quieter in
his life than he did in that hour of near death. A wild expectancy thrilled his
nerves and looked out of his eyes. &ldquo;What would it be like?&rdquo; he
wondered. And in another minute all such thoughts were gone, for he was at the
head of his troop, ready for the order.
</p>

<p>
Alston, followed by the boy Roger, galloped swiftly round, seeing that the
formation was right, and then gave the word to unsheath the short swords with
which he had insisted upon the corps being armed. Meanwhile, the Undi were
drawing on to a flat plain, four hundred yards or more broad, at the foot of
the mountain, a very suitable spot for a cavalry manoeuvre.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, men of Alston&rsquo;s Horse, there is the enemy before you. Let me
see how you can go through them. <i>Charge!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Charge!</i>&rdquo; re-echoed Ernest.
</p>

<div class="fig" style="width:100%;">

<br />
<img src="images/fig12.jpg" width="407" height="600" alt="[Illustration: ]" />
<p class="caption">&ldquo;The last Charge of Alston&rsquo;s Horse.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Charge!</i>&rdquo; roared Sergeant-Major Jones, brandishing his
sword.
</p>

<p>
Down the slope they go, slowly at first; now they are on the plain, and the
pace quickens to a hand-gallop. Ernest feels his great horse gather himself
together and spring along beneath him; he hears the hum of astonishment rising
from the dense black mass before them as it halts to receive the attack; he
glances round, and sees the set faces and determined look upon the features of
his men, and his blood boils up with a wild exhilaration, and for awhile he
tastes the fierce joy of war.
</p>

<p>
Quicker still grows the pace; now he can see the white round the dark eyeballs
of the Zulus.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;<i>Crash!</i>&rdquo; They are among them, trampling them down, hewing
them down, thrusting, slashing, stabbing, and being stabbed. The air is alive
with assegais, and echoes with the savage Zulu war-cries and with the shouts of
the gallant troopers, fighting now as troopers have not often fought before.
Presently, as in a dream, Ernest sees a huge Zulu seize Alston&rsquo;s horse by
the bridle, jerk it on to its haunches, and raise his assegai. Then the boy
Roger, who is by his father&rsquo;s side, makes a point with his sword, and
runs the Zulu through. He falls, but next moment the lad is attacked by more,
is assegaied, and falls fighting bravely. Then Alston pulls up, and, turning,
shoots with his revolver at the men who have killed his son. Two fall, another
runs up, and with a shout drives a great spear right through Alston, so that it
stands out a hand-breadth behind his back. On to the body of his son he, too,
falls and dies. Next second the Zulu&rsquo;s head is cleft in twain down to the
chin. That was Jeremy&rsquo;s stroke.
</p>

<p>
All this time, they are travelling on, leaving a broad red line of dead and
dying in their track. Presently it was done; they had passed right through the
Impi. But out of sixty-four men they had lost their captain and twenty
troopers. As they emerged, Ernest noticed that his sword was dripping blood,
and his sword-hand stained red. Yet he could not at the moment remember having
killed anybody.
</p>

<p>
But Alston was dead, and he was now in command of what remained of the corps.
They were in no condition to charge again, for many horses and some men were
wounded. So he led them round the rear of the Impi, which, detaching a company
of about three hundred men to deal with the remnants of the troop, went on its
way with lessened numbers, and filled with admiration at the exhibition of a
courage in no way inferior to their own.
</p>

<p>
This company, running swiftly, took possession of the ridge down which the
troop had charged, and by which alone it would be possible for Ernest to
retreat, and taking shelter behind stones, began to pour in an inaccurate but
galling fire on the little party of whites. Ernest charged up through them,
losing two more men and several horses in the process; but what was his horror,
on reaching the crest of the ridge, to see about a thousand Zulus, drawn up,
apparently in reserve, in the neck of the pass leading to the plain beyond! To
escape through them would be almost impossible, for he was crippled with
wounded and dismounted men, and the pace of a force is the pace of the slowest.
Their position was desperate, and looking round at his men, he could see that
they thought so too.
</p>

<p>
His resolution was soon taken. A few paces from where he had for a moment
halted the remainder of the corps was a little eminence, something like an
early Saxon tumulus. To this he rode, and, dismounting, turned his horse loose,
ordering his men to do the same. So good was the discipline, and so great his
control over them, that there were no wild rushes to escape: they obeyed,
reaching their desperate case, and formed a ring round the rise.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, men of Alston&rsquo;s Horse,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;we have
done our best, let us die our hardest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The men set up a cheer, and next minute the Zulus, creeping up under shelter of
the rocks which were strewed around, attacked them with fury.
</p>

<p>
In five minutes, in spite of the withering fire which they poured in upon the
surrounding Zulus, six more of the little band were dead. Four were shot, two
were killed in a rush made by about a dozen men, who, reckless of their own
life, determined to break through the white man&rsquo;s ring. They perished in
the attempt, but not before they had stabbed two of Alston&rsquo;s Horse. The
remainder, but little more than thirty men, retired a few paces farther up the
little rise so as to contract their circle, and kept up a ceaseless fire upon
the enemy. The Zulus, thanks to the accurate shooting of the white men, had by
this time lost more than fifty of their number, and, annoyed at being put to
such loss by a foe numerically so insignificant, they determined to end the
matter with a rush. Ernest saw their leader, a great almost naked fellow, with
a small shield and a necklace of lion&rsquo;s claws, walking, utterly
regardless of the pitiless rifle fire, from group to group, and exhorting them.
Taking up a rifle which had just fallen from the hand of a dead
trooper&mdash;for up to the present Ernest had not joined in the
firing&mdash;he took a fine sight at about eighty yards at the Zulu
chief&rsquo;s broad chest, and pulled. The shot was a good one; the great
fellow sprang into the air and dropped. Instantly another commander took his
place and the final advance began.
</p>

<p>
But the Zulus had to come up-hill, with but little cover, and scores were mown
down by the scorching and continuous fire from the breech-loaders. Twice, when
within twenty yards, were they driven back, twice did they come on again. Now
they were but twelve paces or so away, and a murderous fire was kept up upon
them. For a moment they wavered, then pushed forwards up the slope.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Close up!&rdquo; shouted Ernest, &ldquo;and use your swords and
pistols.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His voice was heard above the din. Some of the men dropped the now useless
rifles, and the revolvers began to crack.
</p>

<p>
Then the Zulus closed in upon the doomed band, with a shout of &ldquo;Bulala
umlungo!&rdquo; (Kill the white man!)
</p>

<p>
Out rang the pistol-shots, and fire flew from the clash of swords and assegais;
and still the little band, momentarily growing fewer, fought on with labouring
breath. Never did hope-forsaken men make a more gallant stand. Still they
fought, and still they fell, one by one, and as they fell were stabbed to
death; but scarcely one of them was there whose death-wound was in his back.
</p>

<p>
At last the remaining Zulus drew back; they thought that it was done.
</p>

<p>
But no; three men yet stood together upon the very summit of the mound, holding
six foes at bay. The Zulu captain laughed aloud when he saw it, and gave a
rapid order. Thereupon the remaining Zulus formed up, and stabbing the wounded
as they went, departed swiftly over the dead, after the main body of the corps,
which had now vanished round the mountain.
</p>

<p>
They left the six to finish the three.
</p>

<p>
Three hundred had come to attack Alston&rsquo;s Horse; not more than one
hundred departed from that attack. The overpowered white men had rendered a
good account of their foes.
</p>

<p>
The three left alive on the summit of the little hill were, as Fate would have
it, Ernest, Jeremy, and the ex-sailor, who had complained of the
&ldquo;sargustic&rdquo; companion, who, it happened, had just died by his side.
</p>

<p>
Their revolvers were empty; Ernest&rsquo;s sword had broken off short in the
body of a Zulu; Jeremy still had his sword, and the sailor a clubbed carbine.
</p>

<p>
Presently one of the six Zulus dodged in under the carbine and ran the sailor
through. Glancing round, Ernest saw his face turn grey. The honest fellow died
as he had lived, swearing hard.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, you &mdash;&mdash; black mate,&rdquo; he sang out, &ldquo;take that, and be damned
to you!&rdquo; The clubbed rifle came down upon the Zulu&rsquo;s skull and
cracked it to bits, and both fell dead together.
</p>

<p>
Now there were five Zulus left, and only Ernest and Jeremy to meet them. But
stay; suddenly from under a corpse uprises another foe. No, it is not a foe, it
is Mazooku, who has been shamming dead, but suddenly and most opportunely shows
himself to be very much alive. Advancing from behind, he stabs one of the
attacking party, and kills him. That leaves four. Then he engages another, and
after a long struggle kills him too, which leaves three. And still the two
white men stand back to back with flashing eyes and gasping breath, and hold
their own. Soaked with blood, desperate, and expecting death, they were yet a
gallant sight to see. Two of the remaining Zulus rush at the giant Jeremy, one
at Ernest. Ernest, having no effective weapon left, dodges the assegai thrust,
and then closes with his antagonist, and they roll, over and over, down the
hill together, struggling for the assegai the Zulu holds. It snaps in two, but
the blade and about eight inches of the shaft remain with Ernest. He drives it
through his enemy&rsquo;s throat, and he dies. Then he struggles up to see the
closing scene of the drama, but not in time to help in it. Mazooku has wounded
his man badly, and is following to kill him. And Jeremy? He has struck at one
of the Kafirs, with his sword. The blow is received on the edge of the cowhide
shield, and sinks half-way through it, so that the hide holds the steel fast.
With a sharp twist of the shield the weapon is jerked out of his hand, and he
is left defenceless, with nothing to trust to except his native strength.
Surely he is lost! But no&mdash;with a sudden rush he seizes both Zulus by the
throat, one in each hand, and, strong men as they are, swings them wide apart.
Then with a tremendous effort he jerks their heads together with such awful
force that they fall senseless, and Mazooku comes up and spears them.
</p>

<p class="p2">
</p>

<p>
Thus was the fight ended.
</p>

<p>
Ernest and Jeremy sank upon the bloody grass, gasping for breath. The firing
from the direction of the camp had now died away, and, after the tumult, the
shouts, and the shrieks of the dying, the silence seemed deep.
</p>

<p>
It was the silence of the dead.
</p>

<p>
There they lay, white man and Zulu, side by side in the peaceable sunlight and
in a vague bewildered way Ernest noticed that the faces, which a few minutes
before looked so grim, were mostly smiling now. They had passed through the
ivory gates and reached the land of smiles. How still they all were! A little
black-and-white bird, such as fly from ant-hill to ant-hill, came and settled
upon the forehead of a young fellow, scarcely more than a boy, and the only son
of his mother, who lay quiet across two Zulus. The bird knew why he was so
still. Ernest had liked the boy, and knew his mother, and began to wonder as he
lay panting on the grass what she would feel when she heard of her son&rsquo;s
fate. But just then Mazooku&rsquo;s voice broke the silence. He had been
standing staring at the body of one of the men he had killed, and was now
apostrophising it in Zulu.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, my brother,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;son of my own father, with whom I
used to play when I was little; I always told you that you were a perfect fool
with an assegai but little thought that I should ever have such an opportunity
of proving it to you. Well, it can&rsquo;t be helped; duty is duty, and family
ties must give way to it. Sleep well, my brother; it was painful to kill
you&mdash;very!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest lifted himself from the ground, and laughed the hysterical laugh of
shattered nerves, at this naive and thoroughly Zulu moralising. Just then
Jeremy rose and came to him. He was a fearful sight to see&mdash;his hands, his
face, his clothes, were all red; and he was bleeding from a cut on the face,
and another on the hand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, Ernest,&rdquo; he said, in a hollow voice, &ldquo;we must clear
out of this.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose so,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
On the plain at the foot of the hill several of the horses were quietly
cropping the grass, till such time as the superior animal, man, had settled his
differences. Among them was Ernest&rsquo;s black stallion, &ldquo;The
Devil,&rdquo; which had been wounded, though slightly, on the flank. They
walked towards the horses, stopping on their way to arm themselves from the
weapons which lay about. As they passed the body of the man Ernest had killed
in his last struggle for life, he stopped and drew the broken assegai from his
throat. &ldquo;A memento!&rdquo; said he. The horses were caught without
difficulty, and &ldquo;The Devil&rdquo; and the two next best animals selected.
Then they mounted, and rode towards the top of the ridge over which Ernest had
seen the body of Zulus lying in reserve. When they were near it Mazooku got
down and crept to the crest on his stomach. Presently, to their great relief,
he signalled to them to advance: the Zulus had moved on, and the valley was
deserted. And so the three passed over the neck, that an hour and a half before
they had crossed with sixty-one companions, who were now all dead. &ldquo;I
think we have charmed lives,&rdquo; said Jeremy, presently. &ldquo;All gone
except us two. It can&rsquo;t be chance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is fate,&rdquo; said Ernest, briefly.
</p>

<p>
From the top of the neck they got a view of the camp, which now looked quiet
and peaceful, with its white tents and its Union Jack fluttering as usual in
the breeze.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They must be all dead too,&rdquo; said Ernest; &ldquo;which way shall we
go?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then it was that Mazooku&rsquo;s knowledge of the country proved of the utmost
service to them. He had been brought up at a kraal in the immediate
neighbourhood, and knew every inch of the land. Avoiding the camp altogether,
he led them to the left of the battle-field, and after two hours&rsquo; ride
over rough country, brought them to a ford of the Bulialo which he was
acquainted with, some miles below where the few survivors of the massacre
struggled across the river, or were drowned in attempting to do so. Following
this route they never saw a single Zulu, for these had all departed in the
other direction, and were spared the horrors of the stampede and of
&ldquo;Fugitives&rsquo; Drift.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At last they gained the farther side of the river, and were, comparatively
speaking, safe on Natal ground.
</p>

<p>
They determined, after much anxious consultation, to make for the little fort
at Helpmakaar, and had ridden about a mile or so towards it, when suddenly the
Zulu&rsquo;s quick ear caught the sound of distant firing to their right. It
was their enemy, the Undi Corps, attacking Rorke&rsquo;s Drift. Leaving Mazooku
to hold the horses, Ernest and Jeremy dismounted, and climbed a solitary koppie
or hill which just there cropped out from the surface of the plain. It was of
an ironstone formation, and on the summit lay a huge flat slab of almost pure
ore. On to this they climbed, and looked along the course of the river, but
could see nothing. Rorke&rsquo;s Drift was hidden by a rise in the ground.
</p>

<p>
All this time a dense thundercloud had been gathering in the direction of
Helpmakaar, and was now, as is common before sunset in the South African summer
season, travelling rapidly up against the wind, set in a faint rainbow as in a
frame. The sun, on the other hand, was sinking towards the horizon, so that his
golden beams, flying across a space of blue sky, impinged upon the black bosom
of the cloud, and were reflected thence in sharp lights and broad shadows,
flung like celestial spears and shields across the plains of Zululand.
Isandhlwana&rsquo;s Mountain was touched by one great ray which broke in glory
upon his savage crest, and crowned him that day as king of death, but the
battlefield over which he towered was draped in gloom. It was a glorious scene.
Above, the wild expanse of sky broken up by flaming clouds, and tinted with
hues such as might be reflected from the jewelled walls of heaven. Behind, the
angry storm, set in its rainbow-frame like ebony in a ring of gold. In front,
the rolling plain, where the tall grasses waved, the broad Bulialo flashing
through it like a silver snake, the sun-kissed mountains, and the shadowed
slopes.
</p>

<p>
It was a glorious scene. Nature in her most splendid mood flung all her
colour-streamers loose across the earth and sky, and waved them wildly ere they
vanished into night&rsquo;s abyss. Life, in his most radiant ecstasy, blazed up
in varied glory before he sank, like a lover, to sleep awhile in the arms of
his eternal mistress&mdash;Death.
</p>

<p>
Ernest gazed upon it, and it sank into his heart, which, set to Nature&rsquo;s
tune, responded ever when her hands swept the chords of earth or heaven. It
lifted him above the world, and thrilled him with indescribable emotion. His
eyes wandered over the infinite space above, searching for the presence of a
God; then they fell upon Isandhlwana, and marked the spot just where the
shadows were deepest; where his comrades lay, and gazed upon the splendid sky
with eyes that could not see; and at last his spirit gave way, and, weakened
with emotion and long toil and abstinence, he burst into a paroxysm of grief.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Jeremy,&rdquo; he sobbed, &ldquo;they are all dead, all except you and
I, and I feel a coward that I should still live to weep over them. When it was
over, I should have let that Zulu kill me; but I was a coward, and I fought for
my life. Had I but held my hand for a second, I should have gone with Alston
and the others, Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Come, come, old fellow, you did your best, and fought the corps like a
brick. No man could have done more.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Jeremy, but I should have died with them; it was my duty to die.
And I do not care about living, and they did. I have been an unfortunate dog
all my life. I shot my cousin, I lost Eva, and now I have seen all my comrades
killed, and I, who was their leader, alone escaped, and perhaps I have not done
with my misfortunes yet. What next, I wonder? what next?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest&rsquo;s distress was so acute, that Jeremy, looking at him and seeing
that all he had gone through had been too much for him, tried to soothe him,
lest he should go into hysterics, by putting his arm round his waist and giving
him a good hug.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Look here, old chap,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;it is no use bothering
one&rsquo;s head about these things. We are just so many feathers blown about
by the wind, and must float where the wind blows us. Sometimes it is a good
wind, and sometimes a bad one; but on the whole it is bad, and we must just
make the best of it, and wait till it doesn&rsquo;t think it worth while to
blow our particular feathers about any more, and then we shall come to the
ground, and not till then. And now we have been up here for more than five
minutes, and given the horses a bit of a rest. We must be pushing on if we want
to get to Helpmakaar before dark, and I only hope we shall get there before the
Zulus, that&rsquo;s all. By Jove, here comes the storm&mdash;come on!&rdquo;
And Jeremy jumped off the lump of iron-ore, and began to descend the koppie.
</p>

<p>
Ernest, who had been listening with his face in his hands, rose and followed
him in silence. As he did so, a breath of ice-cold air from the storm-cloud,
which was now right over-head, fanned his hot brow, and when he had gone a few
yards he turned to meet it, and to cast one more look at the scene.
</p>

<p>
It was the last earthly landscape he ever saw. For at that instant there leaped
from the cloud overhead a fierce stream of jagged light, which struck the mass
of iron-ore on which they had been seated, shivered and fused it, and then ran
down the side of the hill to the plain. Together with the lightning there came
an ear-splitting crack of thunder.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy, who was now nearly at the bottom of the little hill, staggered at the
shock. When he recovered, he looked up where Ernest had been standing, and
could not see him. He rushed up the hill again, calling him in accents of
frantic grief. There was no answer. Presently he found him lying on the ground,
white and still.

THE CLIFFS OF OLD ENGLAND</h2>

<p>
It was an April evening; off the south coast of England. The sun had just made
up his mind to struggle out from behind a particularly black shower-cloud, and
give that part of the world a look before he bade it good-night.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is lucky,&rdquo; said a little man, who was with difficulty hanging
on to the bulwark netting of the H.M.S. <i>Conway Castle;</i> &ldquo;now, Mr.
Jones, look if you can&rsquo;t see them in the sunlight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Jones accordingly looked through his glasses again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I can see them distinctly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;See what?&rdquo; asked another passenger, coming up. &ldquo;The cliffs
of Old England,&rdquo; answered the little man, joyously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, is that all?&rdquo; said the other; &ldquo;curse the cliffs of Old
England!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nice remark that for a man who is going home to be married, eh?&rdquo;
said the little man, turning to where his companion had stood.
</p>

<p>
But Mr. Jones had shut up his glasses, and vanished aft.
</p>

<p>
Presently he reached a deck-cabin, and entered without knocking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;England is in sight, old fellow,&rdquo; he said, addressing somebody who
lay back smoking in a cane-chair.
</p>

<p>
The person addressed made a movement as though to rise, then put up his hand to
a shade that covered his eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I forgot,&rdquo; he answered, with a smile; &ldquo;it will have to be
very much in sight before I can see it. By the way, Jeremy,&rdquo; he went on,
nervously, &ldquo;I want to ask you something. These doctors tell such
lies.&rdquo; And he removed the shade. &ldquo;Now, look at my eyes, and tell me
honestly, am I disfigured? Are they shrunk, I mean, or have they got a squint,
or anything of that sort?&rdquo; and Ernest turned up his dark orbs, which,
except that they had acquired that painful, expectant look peculiar to the
blind, were just as they always had been.
</p>

<p>
Jeremy looked at them, first in one light, then in another.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well!&rdquo; said Ernest, impatiently. &ldquo;I can feel that you are
staring me out of countenance.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hamba gachlé,&rdquo; replied the imperturbable one. &ldquo;I am
di&mdash;di&mdash;diagnosing the case. There, that will do. To all appearance,
your optics are as sound as mine. You get a girl to look at them, and see what
she says.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, well; that is something to be thankful for.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then somebody knocked at the cabin-door. It was a steward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You sent for me, Sir Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, I remember. Will you be so good as to find my servant? I want
him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Sir Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest moved impatiently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound that fellow, with his everlasting &lsquo;Sir
Ernest&rsquo;!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What, haven&rsquo;t you got used to your handle yet?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I haven&rsquo;t, and I wish it were at Jericho, and that is a fact.
It is all your fault, Jeremy. If you had not told that confoundedly garrulous
little doctor, who went and had the information printed in the <i>Natal
Mercury,</i> it would never have come out at all. I could have dropped the
title in England; but now all these people know that I am Sir Ernest, and Sir
Ernest I shall remain for the rest of my days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, most people would not think that such a dreadful
misfortune.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, they would, if they had happened to shoot the real heir. By the
way, what did the lawyer say in his letter? As we are so near home, I suppose I
had better post myself up. You will find it in the despatch-box. Read it,
there&rsquo;s a good fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy opened the box, battered with many years of travel, and searched about
for the letter. It contained a curious collection of articles, prominent among
which was a handkerchief, which once belonged to Eva Ceswick; a long tress of
chestnut hair tied up with a blue ribbon; ditto of golden, which had
come&mdash;well, not from Eva&rsquo;s locks; a whole botanical collection of
dead flowers, tender souvenirs of goodness knows who, for, after awhile, these
accumulated dried specimens are difficult to identify; and many letters and
other curiosities.
</p>

<p>
At last Jeremy came to the desired document, written in a fair clerk&rsquo;s
hand; and having shovelled back the locks of hair, &amp;c., began to read it
aloud:
</p>

<p class="right">
<i>St. Ethelred&rsquo;s Court, Poultry,</i>
</p> <p class="right">
<i>22nd January, 1879.</i>
</p>

<p class="letter">
&ldquo;Sir,&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You see,&rdquo; broke in Ernest, &ldquo;while we were fighting over
there at Isandhlwana, those beggars were writing to tell me that I was a
baronet. Case of the &lsquo;bloody hand&rsquo; with a vengeance, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Sir&rdquo; (began Jeremy again), &ldquo;it is our duty to inform you of
the death, on the 16th of the present month, of our esteemed client, Sir Hugh
Kershaw, Bart., of Archdale Hall, Devonshire, and of the consequent devolution
of the baronetcy to yourself, as only son of the late Sir Hugh&rsquo;s only
brother, Ernest Kershaw, Esq.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Into the question of the unhappy manner in which you came to be placed
in the immediate succession it does not become us to enter. We have before us
at this moment a copy of Her Majesty&rsquo;s pardon, granted to you under the
Transvaal Amnesty Act, and forwarded to us by Reginald Cardus, Esq., of
Dum&rsquo;s Ness, Suffolk, which we have neither the wish nor the will to
dispute. It is clear to us that, under this pardon, you are totally free from
any responsibility for the breach of the law which you perpetrated some years
since; and of this it is our duty to advise you your title to succeed is also a
clear one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;As was only to be expected under the circumstances, the late Sir Hugh
did not bear any feeling of goodwill towards you. Indeed, we do not think that
we shall be exaggerating if we say that the news of your free pardon materially
hastened his end. On the attainment of full age by the late Hugh Kershaw, Esq.,
who fell by your hand, the entail of the family estates was cut, and only the
mansion-house of Archdale Hall, the heirlooms, which are numerous and valuable,
therein contained, and the deer-park, consisting of one hundred and eighty-five
acres of land, were resettled. These consequently pass to you, and we shall be
glad to receive your instructions concerning them, should you elect to honour
us with your confidence. The estates pass, under the will of the late Baronet,
to a distant cousin of his late wife&rsquo;s, James Smith, Esq., 52 Camperdown
Road, Upper Clapham. We now think that we have put you in possession of all the
facts connected with your accession to the baronetcy, and, awaiting your
instructions, have the honour to remain,
</p>

<p class="right">
&ldquo;Your obedient servants,
</p> <p class="right">
(Signed) &ldquo;Paisley &amp; Paisley.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, so much for that!&rdquo; was Ernest&rsquo;s comment. &ldquo;What am
I to do with Archdale Hall, its heirlooms, and its deer-park of one hundred and
eighty-five acres, I wonder? I shall sell them if I can. Mine is a pretty
position: a baronet with about sixpence halfpenny per annum to support my rank
on; a very pretty position!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Hamba gachlé,&rdquo; replied Jeremy; &ldquo;time enough to consider all
that. But now, as we are on the reading lay, I may as well give you the benefit
of my correspondence with the officer commanding Her Majesty&rsquo;s forces in
Natal and Zululand.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Fire away!&rdquo; remarked Ernest, wearily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;First letter, dated Newcastle, Natal, 27th January, from your humble
servant to officer commanding, &amp;c.:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&mdash;I have the honour to report, by order of Lieutenant
and Adjutant Kershaw, of Alston&rsquo;s Horse, at present incapacitated by
lightning from doing so himself&rsquo;&mdash;&mdash;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very neatly put that, I think!&rdquo; interpolated Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very. Go on.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&mdash;&ldquo;&lsquo;that on the 22nd inst., Alston&rsquo;s Horse, having received
orders to check the flanking movement of the Undi Corps, proceeded to try and
do so. Coming to a ridge commanding the advance of the Undi, the corps, by
order of their late commander, Captain Alston, dismounted, and opened fire on
them at a distance of about three hundred yards, with considerable effect. This
did not, however, check the Undi, who appeared to number between three and four
thousand men, so Captain Alston issued an order to charge the enemy. This was
done with some success. The Zulus lost a number of men; the corps, which passed
right through the enemy, about twenty troopers, Captain Alston, and his son
Roger Alston, who acted as his aide-de-camp. Several horses and one or two men
were also severely wounded, which crippled the further movements of the corps.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Lieutenant and Adjutant Kershaw, on taking command of the corps,
determined to attempt to retreat. In this attempt, however, he failed, owing to
the presence of dismounted and wounded men; to the detachment of a body of
about three hundred Zulus to intercept any such retreat; and to the presence of
a large body of Zulus on the farther side of the pass leading to the valley
through which such retreat must be conducted.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Under these circumstances he determined to fight the remains of
the corps to the last, and dismounting them, took possession of a fairly
advantageous position. A desperate hand-to-hand encounter ensued. It ended in
the almost total extermination of Alston&rsquo;s Horse, and in that of the
greater part of the attacking Zulus. The names of the surviving members of
Alston&rsquo;s Horse are&mdash;Lieutenant and Adjutant Kershaw, Sergeant-Major
Jeremy Jones, Trooper Mazooku (the only native in the corps). These ultimately
effected their escape, the enemy having either been all destroyed or having
followed the track of the Undi. Lieutenant and Adjutant Kershaw regrets to have
to state that in process of effecting his escape he was struck by lightning and
blinded.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;He estimates the total loss inflicted on the enemy by
Alston&rsquo;s Horse at from four hundred to four hundred and fifty men. In
face of such determined bravery as was evinced by every one of his late gallant
comrades, Lieutenant Kershaw feels that it would be invidious for him to
mention any particular names. Every man fought desperately, and died with his
face to the enemy. He begs to enclose a return of the names of those lost, the
accuracy of which he cannot, however, guarantee, as it is compiled from memory,
the papers of the corps having all been lost. Trusting that the manoeuvres
attempted by Lieutenant Kershaw under somewhat difficult circumstances will
meet with your approval, I have, &amp;c.&mdash;By order of Lieutenant Kershaw,
</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) Jeremy Jones, <i>Sergeant-Major.</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then follows the reply, dated Maritzburg, 2nd February:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;Sir,&mdash;1. I have to direct you to convey to Lieutenant and
Adjutant Kershaw, and the surviving members of the corps known as
Alston&rsquo;s Horse, the high sense entertained by the Officer, &amp;c., of
the gallant conduct of that corps in the face of overwhelming odds at
Isandhlwana on the 22nd of January.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;2. It is with deep regret that the Officer, &amp;c., learns of
the heavy misfortune which has befallen Lieutenant Kershaw. He wishes to
express his appreciation of the way in which that officer handled the remnants
of his corps, and to inform him that his name will be forwarded to the proper
quarter for the expression of Her Majesty&rsquo;s pleasure with regard to his
services.*
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&lsquo;3. I am directed to offer you a commission in any of the
volunteer corps now on service in this campaign.&mdash;I have, &amp;c.,
</p>

<p class="right">
(Signed) &ldquo;&lsquo;CHIEF OF THE STAFF.&rsquo;&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then comes a letter from Sergeant-Major Jones, gratefully acknowledging the
expression of the high opinion of the Officer, &amp;c., and declining the offer
of a commission in another volunteer corps.
</p>

<p>
Next is a private letter from the Officer, &amp;c., offering to recommend
Sergeant-Major Jeremy Jones for a commission in the army.
</p>

<p>
And, finally, a letter from Sergeant-Major Jones to the Officer, &amp;c.,
gratefully declining the same.
</p>

<p>
Ernest looked up sharply. The <i>raison d&rsquo;être</i> of the movement was
gone, for he could no longer see, but the habit remained.
</p>

<p class="footnote">
* It may be stated here that, if this was ever done, the War Office did not
consider Ernest&rsquo;s service worthy of notice; for he never heard anything
more about them.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why did you decline the commission, Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy moved uneasily, and looked through the little cabin-window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On general principles,&rdquo; he answered, presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense! I know you would have liked to go into the army. Don&rsquo;t
you remember, as we were riding up to the camp at Isandhlwana, you said that
you proposed that if the corps did anything, we should try and work it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I said <i>we!</i>&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite follow you, Jeremy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Ernest, you can&rsquo;t go in for a commission now, can
you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed a little bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What has that to do with it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Everything. I am not going to leave you in your misfortune to go and
enjoy myself in the army. I could not do it; I should be wretched if I did. No,
old fellow, we have gone through a good many things side by side, and, please
God, we will stick to each other to the end of the chapter.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest was always easily touched by kindness, especially now that his nerves
were shaken, and his heart softened by misfortune, and his eyes filled with
tears at Jeremy&rsquo;s words. Putting out his hand, he felt about for
Jeremy&rsquo;s, and, when he had found it, grasped it warmly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If I have troubles, Jeremy, at least I have a blessing that few can
boast&mdash;a true friend. If you had gone with the rest at Isandhlwana yonder,
I think that my heart would have broken. I think we do bear one another a love
&lsquo;passing the love of women.&rsquo; It would not be worth much if it
didn&rsquo;t, that is one thing. I wonder if Absalom was a finer fellow than
you are, Jeremy? &lsquo;from the sole of his foot even to the crown of his head
there was no blemish in him.&rsquo; Your hair would not weigh &lsquo;two
hundred shekels after the king&rsquo;s weight,&rsquo; though&rdquo; (Jeremy
wore his hair cropped like a convict&rsquo;s); &ldquo;but I would back you to
throw Absalom over your shoulder, hair and all.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was his fashion to talk nonsense when affected by anything, and Jeremy,
knowing it, said nothing.
</p>

<p>
Just then there came a knock at the door, and who should enter but Mazooku, and
Mazooku transformed. His massive frame, instead of being clothed in the loose
white garments he generally wore, was arrayed in a flannel shirt with an
enormous stick-up collar, a suit of pepper-and-salt reach-me-downs several
sizes too small for him, and a pair of boots considerably too large for his
small and shapely feet; for, like those of most Zulus of good blood, his hands
and feet were extremely delicately made.
</p>

<p>
To add to the incongruity of his appearance, on the top of his hair, which was
still done in ridges, Zulu fashion, and decorated with long bone snuff-spoons,
was perched an extremely small and rakish-looking billycock hat, and in his
hand he carried his favourite and most gigantic knobstick.
</p>

<p>
On opening the cabin-door he saluted in the ordinary fashion, and coming in,
squatted down on his haunches to await orders, forgetting that he was not in
all the freedom of his native dress. The results were most disastrous. With a
crack and a bang the reach-me-down trousers, already strained to their utmost
capacity, split right up the back. The astonished Zulu flew up into the air,
but presently discovering what had happened, sat down again, remarking that
there was &ldquo;much more room now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy burst out laughing, and having sketched his retainer&rsquo;s appearance
for the benefit of Ernest, told him what had happened.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you get those things from, Mazooku?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
Mazooku explained that he had bought the rig-out for three pound ten from a
second-class passenger, as the weather was growing cold.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not wear them again. I will buy you clothes as soon as we get to
England. If you are cold, wear your great-coat.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Koos!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How is &lsquo;The Devil&rsquo;?&rdquo; Ernest had brought the black
stallion on which he had escaped from Isandhlwana home with him.
</p>

<p>
Mazooku replied that the horse was well, but playful. A man forward had been
teasing him with a bit of bread. He had waited till that man passed under his
box, and had seized him in his teeth, lifted him off the ground by his coat,
and shaken him severely.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;&rsquo;Good! Give him a bran-mash to-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Koos!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so you find the air cold. Are you not regretting that you came? I
warned you that you would regret.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ou ka Inkoos&rdquo; (&ldquo;O no, chief&rdquo;), the Zulu answered, in
his liquid native tongue. &ldquo;When first we came upon the smoking ship, and
went out on to the black water out of which the white men rise, and my bowels
twisted up and melted within me, and I went through the agonies of a hundred
deaths, then I regretted. &lsquo;O, why,&rsquo; I said in my heart, &lsquo;did
not Mazimba my father kill me rather than bring me on to this great moving
river? Surely if I live I shall grow like a white man from the whiteness of my
heart, for I am exceedingly afraid, and have cast all my inside forth.&rsquo;
All this I said, and many more things which I cannot remember, but they were
dark and heavy things. But behold! my father, when my bowels ceased to melt,
and when new ones had grown to replace those which I had thrown forth, I was
glad, and did eat much beef, and then I questioned my heart about this journey
over the black water. And my heart answered and said, &lsquo;Mazooku, son of
Ingoluvu, of the tribe of the Maquilisini, of the people of the Amazulu, you
have done well. Great is the chief whom you serve; great is Mazimba on the
hunting-path; great was he in the battle; all the Undi could not kill him, and
his brother the lion (Jeremy), and his servant the jackal (Mazooku), who hid in
a hole and then bit those who digged. O yes, Mazimba is great, and his breast
is full of valour; you have seen him strike the Undi down; and his mind is full
of the white man&rsquo;s knowledge and discretion; you have seen him form the
ring that spat out fire so fast that his servants the horsemen were buried
under the corpses of the Undi. So great is he, that the &ldquo;heaven
above&rdquo; smelled him out as &ldquo;tagati,&rdquo; as a wizard, and struck
him with their lightning, but could not kill him then.&rsquo; And so now my
father wanders and wanders, and shall wander in the darkness, seeing not the
sun or the stars, or the flashing of spears, or the light that gathers in the
eyes of brave men as they close in the battle, or the love which gleams in the
eyes of women. And how is this? Shall my father want a dog to lead him in his
darkness? Shall his dog Mazooku, son of Ingoluvu, prove a faithless dog, and
desert the hand that fed him, and the man who is braver than himself? No, it
shall not be so, my chief and my father. By the head of Chaka, whither thou
goest thither will I go also, and where thou shalt build thy kraal there shall
I make my hut. Koos! Baba!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And having saluted after the dignified Zulu fashion, Mazooku departed to tie up
his split trousers with a bit of string. There was something utterly
incongruous between his present appearance and his melodious and poetical
words, instinct as they were with qualities which in some respects make the
savage Zulu a gentleman, and put him above the white Christian, who for the
most part regards the &ldquo;nigger&rdquo; as a creature beneath contempt. For
there are lessons to be learned even from Zulu &ldquo;niggers,&rdquo; and among
them we may reckon those taught by a courage which laughs at death; an absolute
fidelity to those who have the right to command it, or the qualities necessary
to win it; and, in their raw and unconverted state, perfect honesty and
truthfulness.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a good fellow, Mazooku,&rdquo; said Ernest, when the Zulu had
gone; &ldquo;but I fear that one of two things will happen to him. Either he
will get homesick and become a nuisance, or he will get civilised and become
drunken and degraded. I should have done better to leave him in Natal.&rdquo;
</p>

<h2><a name="chap38"></a>CHAPTER II.<br/>
ERNEST&rsquo;S EVIL DESTINY</h2>

<p>
About nine o&rsquo;clock on the morning following Mazooku&rsquo;s oration, a
young lady came running up the stairs of the principal Plymouth hotel, and
burst into a private sitting-room, like a human bomb-shell of attractive
appearance, somewhat to the astonishment of a bald old gentleman who was
sitting at breakfast.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good gracious, Dorothy, have you gone suddenly mad?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Reginald, the <i>Conway Castle</i> is nearly in, and I have been to
the office and got leave for us to go off in the launch; so come along,
quick!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What time does the launch leave?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A quarter to ten exactly.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then we have three-quarters of an hour.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O please, Reginald, be quick; it might go before, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus smiled, and, rising, put on his hat and coat, &ldquo;to oblige
Dorothy,&rdquo; he said; but, as a matter of fact, he was as excited as she
was. There was a patch of red on each of his pale cheeks, and his hand shook.
</p>

<p>
In a quarter of an hour they were walking up and down the quay by the Custom
House, waiting for the launch to start.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;After all these years,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;and blind!&rdquo;
&ldquo;Do you think that he will be much disfigured, Reginald?&rdquo; &ldquo;I
don&rsquo;t know, dear; your brother said nothing about it.&rdquo; &ldquo;I can
hardly believe it; it seems so strange to think that he and Jeremy should have
been spared out of all those people. How good God is!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A cynic,&rdquo; replied Mr. Cardus, with a smile, &ldquo;or the
relations of the other people, might draw a different conclusion.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Dorothy was thinking how good God was to <i>her.</i> She was dressed in
pink that morning, and
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;Oh, she looked sweet<br/>
As the little pink flower that grows in the wheat.&rdquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>
Dorothy neither was, nor ever would be, a pretty woman, but she was essentially
a charming one. Her kindly puzzled face (and, to judge from the little wrinkles
on it, she had never got to the bottom of the questions which contracted her
forehead as a child), her steady blue eyes, her diminutive rounded form, and,
above all, the indescribable light of goodness which shone round her like a
halo, all made her charming. What did it matter if the mouth was a little wide,
or the nose somewhat &ldquo;tip-tilted?&rdquo; Those who can look so sweet are
able to dispense with such fleshly attributes as a Grecian nose or chiselled
lips. At the least, they will have the best of it after youth is past; and let
me remind you, my young and lovely reader, that the longer and dustier portion
of life&rsquo;s road winds away towards the pale horizon of our path on the
farther side of the grim mile-post marked &ldquo;30.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But what made her chiefly attractive was her piquante taking manner and the
<i>chic</i> of her presence. She was such a perfect lady.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All aboard, if you please,&rdquo; broke in the agent. &ldquo;Run in the
gangway!&rdquo;and they were off towards the great gray vessel with a blue
pennant at her top.
</p>

<p>
It was a short run, but it seemed long to Dorothy and the old gentleman with
her. Bigger and bigger grew the great vessel, till at last it seemed to swallow
up their tiny steamer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ease her! Look out for the line there! Now haul away! Make fast!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was all done in an instant, and next moment they stood upon the broad white
deck, amid the crowd of passengers, and were looking round for Ernest and
Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
But they were not to be seen.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope they are here,&rdquo; faltered Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus took his hat off, and wiped his bald head. He too hoped that they
were there.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Dorothy became aware of a black man, clad in a white smock
pulled on over a great-coat, and carrying a big spear and a kerrie in his hand,
who was pushing his way towards them. Next moment he stood before them,
saluting vigorously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Koos!&rdquo; he said, thrusting his spear into the air before Mr.
Cardus&rsquo;s astonished nose.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Inkosikaas!&rdquo; (chieftainess) he repeated, going through the same
process before Dorothy. &ldquo;This way, master; this way, missie. The chief
without eyes send me to you. This way; the lion bring him now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They followed him through the press towards the after-part of the ship, while,
giving up the unfamiliar language, he vociferated in Zulu (it might have been
Sanskrit, for all they knew):
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Make way, you low people, make way for the old man with the shining
head, on whose brow sits wisdom, and the fair young maiden, the sweet rosebud,
who comes,&rdquo; &amp;c.
</p>

<p>
At that moment Dorothy&rsquo;s quick eye saw a great man issuing from a cabin,
leading another man by the hand. And then she forgot everything, and ran
forward.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest, Ernest!&rdquo; she cried.
</p>

<p>
The blind man&rsquo;s cheek flushed at the music of her voice.
</p>

<p>
He drew his hand from Jeremy&rsquo;s, and stretched out his arms towards the
voice. It would have been easy to avoid them&mdash;one never need be kissed by
a blind man&mdash;but she did not avoid them. On the contrary, she placed
herself so that the groping arms closed round her, while a voice said:
&ldquo;Dolly, where are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Here, Ernest, here!&rdquo; and in another moment he had drawn her to
him, and kissed her on the face, and she had returned the kiss.
</p>

<p>
Then she kissed Jeremy too, or rather Jeremy lifted her up two or three feet
and kissed her&mdash;it came to the same thing. And then Mr. Cardus wrung them
both by the hand, wringing Ernest&rsquo;s the hardest; and Mazooku stood by,
and, Zulu fashion, chanted a little song of his own improvising, about how the
chiefs came back to their kraal after a long expedition, in which they had,
&amp;c.; and how Wisdom, in the shape of a shining headed and ancient one, the
husband without any doubt of many wives, and the father of at least a hundred
children, &amp;c.; and Beauty, in the shape of a sweet and small one, &amp;c.;
and finally they all went very near to crying, and dancing a fling on the
quarter-deck together.
</p>

<p>
And then they all talked at once, and set about collecting their things in a
muddle-headed fashion. When these had been put in a pile, and Mazooku was
seated, assegai and all, upon the top of them, as a solemn warning to thieves
(and ill would it have gone with the thief who dared to meddle with that pile),
they started off to inspect Ernest&rsquo;s great black horse, &ldquo;The
Devil.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And behold, Dorothy stroked &ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s&rdquo; nose, and he,
recognising how sweet and good she was, abandoned his usual habits, and did not
bite her, but only whinnied and asked for sugar. Then Ernest, going into the
box with the horse, which nobody but he and Mazooku were fond of taking
liberties with, felt down his flank till he came to a scar inflicted by an
assegai in that mad charge through the Undi, and showed it to them. And
Dorothy&rsquo;s eyes filled with tears of thankfulness, as she thought of what
that horse and its rider had gone through, and of the bleaching bones of those
who had galloped by their side; and she would have liked to kiss Ernest again,
only there was no excuse. So she only pressed his hand, feeling that the sorrow
of the empty years which were gone was almost atoned for by this hour of joy.
</p>

<p>
Then they went ashore to the hotel, and sat together in the pleasant
sitting-room which Dorothy had chosen, and made sweet with great bunches of
violets (for she remembered that Ernest loved violets), and talked. At length
Mr. Cardus and Jeremy went off to see about getting the things through the
Custom House, where they arrived to find Mazooku keeping half a dozen gorgeous
officials, who wanted to open a box, at bay with his knobsticks, and plastering
them with offensive epithets, which fortunately they did not understand.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; said Ernest, presently, &ldquo;it is a beautiful day, is it
not? Will you take me for a walk, dear? I should like to go for a walk.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Ernest, of course I will.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are sure you do not mind being seen with a blind man? You must give
me your hand to hold, you know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, how can you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mind giving him her hand to hold, indeed! thought Dorothy to herself, as she
ran to put her bonnet on. O, that she could give it to him for always! And in
her heart she blessed the accident of his blindness, because it brought him so
much nearer to her. He would be helpless without her, this tall strong man, and
she would be ever at his side to help him. He would not be able to read a book,
or write a letter, or move from room to room without her. Surely she would soon
be able so to weave herself into his life that she would become indispensable
to it. And then, perhaps&mdash;perhaps&mdash;and her heart pulsed with a joy so
intense at the mere thought of what might follow that it became a pain, and she
caught her breath and leaned against the wall. For every fibre of her frame was
thrilled with a passionate love of this blind man whom she had lost for so many
years, and now had found again; and in her breast she vowed that if she could
help it she would lose him no more. Why should she? When he had been engaged to
Eva, she had done her best for him and her, and bitterly had she felt the way
in which he had been treated, but Eva had taken her own course, and was now no
longer in the outward and visible running, whatever place she might still hold
in the inward and spiritual side of Ernest&rsquo;s nature.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy did not underrate that place; she knew well that the image of her rival
had sunk too deep into his heart to be altogether dislodged by her. But she was
prepared to put up with that.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;One can&rsquo;t have everything, you know,&rdquo; she said, shaking her
wise little head at her own reflection in the glass, as she tied her
bonnet-strings.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was an eminently practical little person, and having recognised the
&ldquo;eternal verity&rdquo; of the saying that half a loaf is better than no
bread, especially if one happens to be dying of hunger, she made up her mind to
make the best of the position. Since she could not help it, Eva would be
welcome to the inward and spiritual side of Ernest, if only she could secure
the outward and visible side; &ldquo;for after all, that is real and tangible,
and there isn&rsquo;t much comfort in spiritual affection, you know,&rdquo; she
said, with another shake of the head.
</p>

<p>
In short, the arguments which proved so convincing to her were not unlike those
that carried conviction home to the gentle breast of Mr. Plowden, when he made
up his mind to marry Eva in the teeth of her engagement to, and love for,
Ernest; but, putting aside the diversity of the circumstances, there was this
difference between them: Mr. Plowden recognised no higher spiritual part at
all; he did not believe in that sort of thing; he contracted for Eva as he
would have contracted to buy a lovely animal, and when he had got the given
quantity of flesh and blood he was satisfied. Of the soul&mdash;the inner
self&mdash;which the human casket held, and which loathed and hated him, he
took no account. He had got the woman, what did he care about the woman&rsquo;s
soul? Souls, and spiritual parts, and affinities with what is good and high,
and the divinity of love, &amp;c. &amp;c., were capital things to preach about,
but they did not apply to the affairs of every-day life. Besides, if he had
been asked, he would have given it as his candid opinion that women did not
possess any of these things.
</p>

<p>
There are hundreds of educated men who think like Mr. Plowden, and there are
thousands of educated ladies who give colour to such opinions by their idle,
aimless course of life, their utter inappreciation of anything beyond their own
little daily round, and the gossip of the dozen or so of families who for them
make up what they call society and the interests of existence, and by their
conduct in the matter of marriage. Truly the great factor in the lowering of
women is woman herself. But what does it matter? In due course they have their
families, and the world goes on!
</p>

<p>
Now, Dorothy did believe in all these things, and she knew what an important
part they play in human affairs, and how they dominate over, and direct, finer
minds. So did she believe in the existence of the planets, and in the blooming
of roses in walled gardens; but she could not get near to know the beauties of
the stars, or to see the opening rosebuds, so she had to satisfy herself with
the heat that poured from the one, and the scent that came from the other. When
one is star-stricken, or mad in the matter of roses, that is better than
nothing.
</p>

<p>
And so, taking Ernest by the hand, she led him through the crowded streets with
tender care, and on to the quiet Hoe. And as they passed, the people turned to
look at the handsome young fellow who was blind, and some thought that they
would not mind a little blindness if it led to being personally conducted by so
sweet a girl.
</p>

<p>
Soon they reached the gardens.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now tell me about yourself, Ernest. What have you been doing all these
long years, besides growing bigger and handsomer, and getting that hard look
about the mouth?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A great many things, Doll. Shooting, fighting, playing the fool.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pshaw! I know all that, or at least I can guess it. What have you been
doing in your mind, you know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, thinking of you, of course, Doll.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, if you talk to me like that, I will go away, and leave you to
find your own way home. I know well of whom you have been thinking every day
and every night. It was not of me. Now, confess it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s talk of <i>her,</i> Doll. If you talk of the
devil, you know, you sometimes raise him; not that he requires much raising in
this instance,&rdquo; he laughed bitterly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was so sorry for you, Ernest dear, and I did my best; indeed I did.
But I could do nothing with her. She must have been off her head, or that
man&rdquo; (Dorothy always spoke of Plowden as &lsquo;that man&rsquo;)&rdquo;
and Florence had some power over her; or perhaps she never really cared for
you; there are some women, you know, who seem very sweet, but cannot truly care
for anybody except themselves. At any rate, she married, and has a family of
children, for I have seen their births in the paper. Oh, Ernest, when I think
of all you must have suffered out there about that woman, I cease to be sorry
for her, and begin to hate her. I am afraid you have been very unhappy, Ernest,
all these years.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, yes, I have been unhappy sometimes&mdash;sometimes I have consoled
myself. There, what is the use of telling lies?&mdash;I have always been
unhappy, and never so much so as when I have been in process of consolation.
But you should not hate her, poor girl! Perhaps she has her bad times too;
only, fortunately, you women cannot feel, at least not much&mdash;not like us,
I mean.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about that,&rdquo; put in Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I will qualify my remark&mdash;most women. And, besides, it is not
quite her fault; people cannot help themselves much in this world. She was
appointed to be my evil destiny, that is all, and she must fulfil her mission.
All my life she will probably bring me trouble, till at last the fate works
itself out. But, Dolly, my dear, there must be an end to these things, and
Nature, always fertile in analogies, teaches us that the end of sorrow will be
happiness. It is from the darkness of night that day is born, and ice and snow
are followed by the flowers. Nothing is lost in the world, as old Alston used
to say, and it is impossible to suppose that all the grief and suffering are
alone wasted; that they are the only dull seed that will not, when their day
comes, bloom into a beautiful life. They may seem to be intangible things now;
but, after all, the difference between tangible and intangible is only a
difference of matter. We know that intangible things are real enough, and
perhaps in a future state we shall find that they are the true immortal parts.
I think so myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think so too.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, Doll, you see, if once one gets the mastery of that idea, it
makes the navigation easier. Once admit that everything works to an end, and
that end a good and enduring one, and you will cease to call out under your
present sorrows. But it is hard for the little boy to learn to like being
whipped, and we are all children, Doll, to the end of our days.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And you see, Doll, for some reason I have been picked out to catch it
pretty warm. It does seem rather hard that a woman like that should be allowed
to turn all the wine of a man&rsquo;s life into vinegar; but so it often is.
Now, if she had died, that would have been bad enough; but I could have borne
it, and bided my time in the hope of joining her. Or if she had ceased to love
me, and learned to love the other man, I think I could have borne that, because
my pride would have come to my rescue, and because I know that the law of her
affections is the only law that the heart of woman really acknowledges, however
many others she may be forced to conform to; and that a woman of refined nature
who has ceased to love you, and is yet forced to live with you, is in
consequence a thing worthless to you, and dishonoured in her own eyes. Besides,
I ask no favour in such matters. I have no sympathy, as a general rule, with
people who raise a howl because they have lost the affection of their wives or
sweethearts, for they should have been able to keep them. If any man could have
cut me out, he was welcome to do so, for he would have proved himself the
better man, and as for the lady, I would not have her without her heart. But I
gather that was not quite the case with Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O no, indeed; at least she said that she was wretched.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Exactly as I thought. Well, now, you will understand that it is rather
hard. You see I did love her dearly, and it is painful to think of this woman,
whose love I won, and who by that divine right and by the law of nature should
have been my wife, as forced into being the wife of another man, however
charming he may be; and I hope for her sake that he is charming. In fact, it
fills me with a sensation I cannot describe.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Poor Ernest!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh no, don&rsquo;t pity me. Everybody has his troubles&mdash;this is
mine.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Ernest, but you have been unfortunate, and now your sight has gone;
but perhaps Critchett or Couper would be able to do something for that.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All the Critchetts and Coupers in the world will never do anything for
it, my dear. But you must remember that where I only lost my sight, many others
lost their lives, and it is supposed to be better to lose your sight than your
life. Besides, blindness has its advantages: it gives you so much more time to
think, and it humbles you so. You can have no idea what it is like, Doll.
Intense, everlasting blackness hedging you in like a wall: one long, long
night, even when the sunlight is beating on your face; and out of the night,
voices and the touching of hands, like the voices and the touchings of departed
spirits. Your physical body is as helpless and as much at the mercy of the
world as your spiritual body is in the hands of the Almighty. And things grow
dim to you too: you begin to wonder what familiar faces and sights are like, as
you wonder about the exact appearance of those who died many years ago, or of
places you have not seen for years. All of which, my dear Doll, is very
favourable to thought. When next you lie awake for five or six hours in the
night, try to reckon all the things which occupy your brain; then imagine such
wakefulness and its accompanying thoughts extended over the period of your
natural life, and you will get some idea of the depth and breadth and height of
total blindness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His words struck her, and she did not know what to answer, so she only pressed
his hand in token of her mute sympathy.
</p>

<p>
He understood her meaning; the faculties of the blind are very quick.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know, Doll,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;coming back to you and to your
gentle kindness is like coming into the peace and quiet of a sheltered harbour
after bearing the full brunt of the storm.&rdquo; Just then a cloud which had
obscured the sun passed away, and its full light struck upon his face.
&ldquo;There,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;it is like that. It is like emerging
into the sweet sunshine after riding for miles through the rain and mist. You
bring peace with you, my dear. I have not felt such peace for years as I feel
holding your hand to-day.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am very glad, dear Ernest,&rdquo; she answered; and they walked on in
silence. At that moment, a little girl, who was trundling a hoop down the
gravel-path, stopped her hoop to look at the pair. She was very pretty, with
large dark eyes, but Dorothy noticed that she had a curious mark upon her
forehead. Presently Dorothy saw her run back towards an extremely tall and
graceful woman, who was sauntering along, followed at some distance by a nurse
with a baby in her arms, and turning occasionally to look at the beds of spring
flowers, hyacinths and tulips, which bordered the path.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O mother!&rdquo; she heard the little girl call out, in the clear voice
of childhood, &ldquo;there is such a nice blind man! He isn&rsquo;t old and
ugly, and he hasn&rsquo;t a dog, and he doesn&rsquo;t ask for pennies. Why is
he blind if he hasn&rsquo;t a dog, and doesn&rsquo;t ask for pennies?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Blindness, according to this little lady&rsquo;s ideas, evidently sprang from
the presence of a cur and an unsatisfied hunger for copper coin. Sometimes it
does.
</p>

<p>
The tall graceful lady looked up carelessly, saying, &ldquo;Hush, dear!&rdquo;
She was quite close to them now, for they were walking towards each other, and
Dorothy gave a great gasp, for before her stood <i>Eva Plowden.</i> There was
no doubt about it. She was paler and haughtier-looking than of yore; but it was
she. No one who had once seen her could mistake that queenly beauty. Certainly
Dorothy could not mistake it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the matter, Doll?&rdquo; said Ernest, carelessly. He was
thinking of other things.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing; I hurt myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They were quite close now.
</p>

<p>
And Eva, too, looked at them, and she, too, saw the face she had never thought
to see again. With all her eyes, and with her lips parted as though to cry out,
she gazed at the sight before her&mdash;slowly, slowly, taking in all it meant.
</p>

<p>
They were nearly level now.
</p>

<p>
Then there leaped up into her eyes and face&mdash;the eyes and face which a
second before had been so calm and statue-like&mdash;a wild light of love, an
intensity of passionate and jealous desire, such as is not often to be seen on
the faces of women.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest there, and Ernest blind, and being led by the hand of Dorothy,
and looking happy with her! How dared she touch her love! How dared he look
happy with her!&rdquo; Those were the thoughts which flashed through her
troubled mind.
</p>

<p>
She made a step towards them, as though to address him, and the blind eyes fell
upon her lovely face, and wandered over it. It made her mad. His eyes were on
her face, and yet he could not see her. O God!
</p>

<p>
Dorothy saw the motion, and, moved by an overmastering instinct, threw herself
between them in an attitude of protection not unmixed with defiance. And so,
for a second, their eyes flashing and their bosoms heaving with emotion, the
two women stood face to face, and the blind pathetic eyes wandered uneasily
over both, feeling a presence they were unable to define.
</p>

<p>
It was a tragic, almost a dreadful scene. The passions it revealed were almost
too intense for words, as no brush can justly paint a landscape made vivid by
the unnatural fierceness of the lightning.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Doll, why do you stop?&rdquo; Ernest said, impatiently.
</p>

<p>
His voice broke the spell. Eva withdrew her arm, which was half outstretched,
and touched her lips with her finger as though to enjoin silence. Then a deep
misery spread itself over her flushed face, her head sank low, and she passed
thence with rapid steps. Presently the nurse with the baby followed her, and
Dorothy noticed vaguely that this child had also a mark upon its forehead. The
whole thing had not taken forty seconds.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; said Ernest, in a wild voice, and commencing to tremble,
&ldquo;who was that passed us?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lady,&rdquo; was the answer.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;A lady; yes, I know that&mdash;what lady?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know&mdash;a lady with children.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a fib; but she could not tell him then; an instinct warned her not to do
so.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, it is strange, Doll, strange; but, do you know, I felt just now as
though Eva were very near me. Come, let us go home!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Just then the cloud got over the sun again, and they walked home in the shadow.
Apparently, too, all their talkativeness had gone the way of the sun. They had
nothing to say.
</p>

<div class="chapter">

<h2><a name="chap39"></a>CHAPTER III.<br/>
INTROSPECTIVE</h2>

<p>
Eva Plowden could scarcely be said to be a happy woman. A refined woman who has
deliberately married one man when she loves another is not as a rule happy
afterwards, unless, indeed, she is blessed, or cursed, with a singularly
callous nature. But there are degrees and degrees of unhappiness. Such a fate
as Eva&rsquo;s would have killed Dorothy, and would have driven Florence, bad
as she might otherwise be, to suicide or madness. But with Eva herself it was
not so; she was not sufficiently finely strung to suffer thus. Hers was not a
very happy life, and that was all about it. She had been most miserable; but
when the first burst of her misery had passed, like the raving storm that
sometimes ushers in a wet December day, she had more or less reconciled
herself&mdash;like a sensible woman&mdash;to her position. The day was always
rather wet, it is true; but still the sun peeped out now and again, and if life
was not exactly a joyous thing, it was at least endurable.
</p>

<p>
And yet with it all she loved Ernest in her heart as much as ever; his memory
was inexpressibly dear to her, and her regrets were sometimes very bitter. On
the whole, however, she had got over it wonderfully&mdash;better than anybody
would have thought possible, who could have witnessed her agony some years
before, when Florence told her the whole truth immediately after the wedding.
The Sabine women, we are told, offered every reasonable resistance to their
rape by the Romans, but before long they gave the strongest proofs of
reconciliation to their lot. There was something of the Sabine woman about Eva.
Indeed, the contrast between her state of mind as regarded Ernest, and
Ernest&rsquo;s state of mind as regarded her, would make a curious study. They
each loved the other, and yet how different had the results of that love been
on the two natures! To Eva it had been and was a sorrow, sometimes a very real
one; to Ernest, the destruction of all that made life worth living. The
contrast, indeed, was almost pitiable, it was so striking; so wide a gulf was
fixed between the two. The passion of the one was a wretched thing compared to
the other. But both were real; it was merely a difference of degree. If
Eva&rsquo;s affection was weak when measured by Ernest&rsquo;s, it was because
the soil in which it grew was poorer. She gave all she had to give.
</p>

<p>
As for Mr. Plowden, he could not but feel that on the whole his matrimonial
speculation had answered very well. He was honestly fond of his wife, and, as
he had a right to be, very proud of her. At times she was cold and capricious,
and at times she was sarcastic; but, take it altogether, she made him a good
and serviceable wife, and lifted him up many pegs in the social scale. People
saw that though Plowden was not a gentleman, he had managed to marry a lady,
and a very lovely lady too; and he was tolerated, indeed to a certain extent
courted, for the sake of his wife. It was principally to attain this end that
he had married her, so he had every reason to be satisfied with his bargain,
and he was, besides, proud to be the legal owner of so handsome a creature.
</p>

<p>
Eva often thought of her old lover, though, except in the vaguest way, she had
heard nothing of him for years. Indeed, she was, as it happened, thinking of
him tenderly enough that very morning, when her little girl had called her
attention to the &ldquo;nice blind man.&rdquo; And when at last, in a way which
seemed to her little short of miraculous, she set eyes again upon his face, all
her smouldering passion broke into flame, and she felt that she still loved him
with all her strength, such as it was.
</p>

<p>
At that moment indeed she realised how great, how bitter, how complete was the
mistake she had made, and what a beautiful thing life might have been for her
if things had gone differently. But, remembering how things <i>were,</i> she
bowed her head and passed on, for the time completely crushed.
</p>

<p>
Presently, however, two points became clear in the confusion of her mind,
taking shape and form as distinct and indisputable mental facts, and these
were&mdash;first, that she was wildly jealous of Dorothy; second, that it was
her fixed determination to see Ernest. She regretted now that she had been too
overcome to go up and speak to him, for see him she must and would; indeed, her
sick longing to look upon his face and hear his voice filled her with alarm.
</p>

<p>
Eva reached her home, after the meeting on the Hoe, just before luncheon-time.
Her husband was now acting as locum tenens for the rector of one of the
Plymouth parishes. They had moved thus from place to place for years, waiting
for the Kesterwick living to fall vacant, and Eva liked the roving life well
enough&mdash;it diverted her thoughts.
</p>

<p>
Presently she heard her husband enter, bringing somebody else with him, and
summoned up the sweet smile for which she was remarkable to greet him.
</p>

<p>
In another instant he was in the room, followed by a fresh-faced subaltern,
whose appearance reminded her of the pictures of cherubs. Mr. Plowden had
changed but little since we saw him last, with the exception that his hair was
now streaked with white, and the whole face rather stouter. Otherwise the cold
gray eyes were as cold as ever, and the countenance of Plowden was what the
countenance of Plowden had always been&mdash;powerful, intelligent, and
coarse-looking.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let me introduce my friend Lieutenant Jasper to you, my dear,&rdquo; he
said, in his full strong voice, which was yet unpleasant to the ear. &ldquo;We
met at Captain Johnstone&rsquo;s, and, as it is a long way to go to the
barracks for lunch, I asked him to come and take pot-luck with us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The cherubic Jasper had screwed an eyeglass into his round eye, and through it
was contemplating Eva with astonished ecstasy; but, like most very beautiful
women, she was used to that sort of thing, and it only amused her faintly. Mr.
Plowden, too, was used to it, and took it as a personal compliment.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am delighted,&rdquo; she murmured, and held out her hand.
</p>

<p>
The cherub, suddenly awaking to the fact, dropped his eyeglass, and, plunging
at the hand, seized it as a pike does a little fish, and shook it with
enthusiasm.
</p>

<p>
Eva smiled again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Shall we go to lunch?&rdquo; she said, sweetly: and they went to lunch,
she sailing down in front of them with the grace of a swan.
</p>

<p>
At lunch itself the conversation flagged rather&mdash;that is, Mr. Plowden
talked with all the facility of an extemporary preacher; the cherub gazed at
this pale dark-eyed angel; and Eva, fully occupied with her own thoughts,
contributed a great many appreciative smiles and a few random remarks. Just as
they were, to her intense relief, nearing the conclusion of the meal, a
messenger arrived to summon Mr. Plowden to christen a dying baby. He got up at
once, for he was punctilious in the performance of his duties, and, making
excuses to his guest, departed on his errand, thus forcing Eva to carry on the
conversation.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Have you been in Plymouth long, Mr. Jasper?&rdquo; she asked.
</p>

<p>
The eyeglass dropped spasmodically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Plymouth? O dear, no; I only landed this morning.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Landed? Indeed! where from? I did not know that any boat was in except
the <i>Conway Castle.</i>
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I came by her, from the Zulu war, you know. I was invalided home
for fever.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The cherub suddenly became intensely interesting to Eva, for it had struck her
that Ernest must have come from Africa.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Indeed! I hope you had a pleasant passage. It depends so much on your
fellow-passengers, does it not?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, we had a very nice lot of men on board, wounded officers mostly.
There were a couple of very decent civilians, too&mdash;a giant of a fellow
called Jones, and a blind baronet, Sir Ernest Kershaw.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva&rsquo;s bosom heaved.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I once knew a Mr. Ernest Kershaw; I wonder if it is the same? He was
tall, and had dark eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That&rsquo;s the man; he only got his title a month or two ago. A
melancholy sort of chap, I thought; but then he can&rsquo;t see now. That Jones
is a wonderful fellow, though&mdash;could pull two heavy men up at once, as
easily as you would lift a puppy-dog. Saw him do it myself. I knew them both
out there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Where did you meet them?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, it was rather curious. I suppose you heard of the great disaster
at that place with an awful name. Well, I was at a beastly hole called
Helpmakaar, when a fellow came riding like anything from Rorke&rsquo;s Drift,
telling us what had happened, and that the Zulus were coming. So we all set to
and worked like mad, and just as we had got the place a little fit for them,
somebody shouted that he saw them coming. That was just as it was getting dark.
I ran to the wall to look, and saw, not the Zulus, but a great big fellow
carrying a dead fellow in his arms, followed by a Kafir leading three horses.
At least, I thought the fellow was dead, but he wasn&rsquo;t&mdash;he had been
struck by lightning. We let him in; and such a sight as they were you never
saw, all soaked with blood from top to toe!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah! And how did they come like that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They were the only survivors of a volunteer corps called Alston&rsquo;s
Horse. They killed all the Zulus that were attacking them, when the Zulus had
killed everybody except them. Then they came away, and the blind
fellow&mdash;that is, Sir Ernest&mdash;got struck in a storm; fellows often do
out there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva put further questions, and listened with breathless interest to the story
of Ernest&rsquo;s and Jeremy&rsquo;s wonderful escape, so far as the details
were known to Mr. Jasper, quite regardless of the pitiless fire that young
gentleman was keeping on herself through his eyeglass. At last, reluctantly
enough, he rose to go.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I must be off now, Mrs. Plowden; I want to go and call on Sir Ernest at
the hotel. He lent me a Derringer pistol to practise at a bottle with, and I
forgot to give it back.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva turned the full battery of her beautiful eyes upon him. She saw that the
young gentleman was struck, and determined to make use of him. Women are
unscrupulous when they have an end in view.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I am so sorry you must go; but I hope you will come and see me again,
and tell me some more about the war and the battles.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very kind,&rdquo; he stammered. &ldquo;I shall be
delighted.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not think it necessary to add that he had not had the luck to see a shot
fired himself. Why should he?
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By the way, if you are going to see Sir Ernest, do you think you could
give him a private message from me? I have a reason for not wishing it to be
overheard.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O yes, I daresay I can. Nothing would give me greater pleasure.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very good.&rdquo; Another glance. &ldquo;Will you tell him that
I wish he would take a fly and come to see me? I shall be in all this
afternoon.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
A pang of jealousy shot through the cherubic bosom, but he comforted himself
with the reflection that a fine woman like that could not care for a
&ldquo;blind fellow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, certainly, I will try.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you;&rdquo; and she extended her hand.
</p>

<p>
He took it, and, intoxicated by those superb eyes, ventured to press it
tenderly. A mild wonder took possession of Eva&rsquo;s mind that anybody so
very young could have developed such an astonishing amount of impudence, but
she did not resent the pressure. What did she care about having her hand
squeezed when it was a question of seeing Ernest?
</p>

<p>
Poor deluded cherub!

<h2><a name="chap40"></a>CHAPTER IV.<br/>
AFTER MANY DAYS</h2>

<p>
Within an hour of the departure of Lieutenant Jasper, Eva heard a fly draw up
at the door. Then came an interval and the sound of two people walking up the
steps, one of whom stumbled a good deal; then a ring.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is Mrs. Plowden at home?&rdquo; said a clear voice, the well-remembered
tones of which sent the blood to her head and then back to her heart with a
rush.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, sir.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh! Wait here, flyman. Now, my good girl, I must ask you to give me your
hand, for I am not in a condition to find my way about strange places.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Another pause, and the drawing-room door opened, and the maid came in, leading
Ernest, who wore a curious, drawn look upon his face.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do?&rdquo; she said, in a low voice, coming and taking him by
the hand. &ldquo;That will do, Jane.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He did not speak till the door closed; he only looked at her with those
searching blind eyes.
</p>

<p>
Thus they met again after many years.
</p>

<p>
She led him to a sofa, and he sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do not leave go of my hand,&rdquo; he said quickly; &ldquo;I have not
yet got used to talking to people in the dark.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She sat down on the sofa beside him, feeling frightened and yet happy. For
awhile they remained silent; apparently they could find nothing to say, and,
after all, silence seemed most fitting. She had never thought to sit hand in
hand with him again. She looked at him; there was no need for her to keep a
guard over her loving glances, for he was blind. At length she broke the
silence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Were you surprised to get my message?&rdquo; she asked, gently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; it was like getting a message from the dead. I never expected to
see you again. I thought that you had quite passed out of my life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So you had forgotten me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you say such a thing to me? You must know, Eva, that it is
impossible for me to forget you; I almost wish that it were possible. I meant
that you had passed out of my outward life, for out of my mind you can never
pass.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva hung her head and was silent, and yet his words sent a thrill of happiness
through her. So she had not quite lost him after it all.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Listen, Eva,&rdquo; Ernest went on, gathering himself together, and
speaking sternly enough now, and with a strange suppressed energy that
frightened her. &ldquo;How you came to do what you have done you best
know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is done; do not let us speak of it. I was not altogether to
blame,&rdquo; she broke in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I was not going to speak of it. But I was going to say this, now while I
have the chance, because time is short, and I think it right that you should
know the truth. I was going to tell you just that for what you have done I
freely forgive you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is,&rdquo; he went on, not heeding her, &ldquo;a question that you
can settle with your conscience and your God. But I wish to tell you what it is
that you have done. You have wrecked my life, and made it an unhappy thing; you
have taken that from me which I can never have to give again; you have
embittered my mind, and driven me to sins of which I should not otherwise have
dreamed. I loved you, and you gave me proofs which I could not doubt that I had
won your love. You let me love you, and then when the hour of trial came you
deserted and morally destroyed me, and the great and holy affection that should
have been the blessing of my life has become its curse.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Eva covered her face with her hands and sat silent.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do not answer me, Eva,&rdquo; he said presently, with a little
laugh. &ldquo;Perhaps you find what I have to say difficult to answer, or
perhaps you think I am taking a liberty.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very hard,&rdquo; she said, in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Had you not better wait till I have done before you call me hard? If I
wished to be hard, I should tell you that I no longer cared for you, that my
prevailing feeling towards you was one of contempt. It would, perhaps, mortify
you to think that I had shaken off such heavy chains. But it is not the truth,
Eva. I love you now, as I always have loved you, as I always shall love you. I
hope for nothing, I ask for nothing; in this business it has always been my
part to give, not to receive. I despise myself for it, but so it is.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She laid her hand upon his shoulder. &ldquo;Spare me, Ernest,&rdquo; she
whispered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have very little more to say, only this: I believe all that I have
given you has not been given uselessly. I believe that the love of the flesh
will die with the flesh. But my love for you has been something more and higher
than that, or how has it lived without hope, and in spite of its dishonour,
through so many years? It is of the spirit, and I believe that its life will be
like that of the spirit, unending, and that when this hateful existence is done
with I shall in some way reap its fruits with you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you believe that, Ernest? It seems too happy to be true.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do I believe it? I cannot tell you. Perhaps it is nothing but the
fantasy of a mind broken down with brooding on its grief. In trouble we grow
towards the light&mdash;like a plant in the dark, you know. As a crushed flower
smells sweet, so all that is most aspiring in human nature is called into life
when God lays His heavy hand upon us. Heaven is sorrow&rsquo;s sole ambition.
No, Eva, I do not know why I believe it&mdash;certainly you have given me no
grounds for this&mdash;but I do believe it, and it comforts me. By the way, how
did you know that I was here?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I passed you on the Hoe this morning, walking with Dorothy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest started. &ldquo;I felt you pass,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and asked
Dorothy who it was. She said she did not know.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She knew, but I made a sign to her not to say.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, will you promise me something?&rdquo; asked Eva, wildly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nothing. I have changed my mind&mdash;nothing at all!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The promise that she was about to ask was that he would not marry Dorothy, but
her better nature rose in rebellion against it. Then they talked awhile of
Ernest&rsquo;s life abroad.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Ernest, rising after a pause, &ldquo;good-bye,
Eva.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is a very cruel word,&rdquo; she murmured.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is cruel, but not more cruel than the rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It has been a happiness to see you, Ernest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He shrugged his shoulders as he answered. &ldquo;Has it? For myself I am not
sure if it has been a happiness or a misery. I must have a year or two of quiet
and darkness to think it over before I make up my mind. Will you kindly ring
the bell for the servant to take me away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Half unconsciously she obeyed him, and then she came and took his hand and
looked with all her eyes and all her soul into his face. It was fortunate that
he could not see her.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest, you are blind!&rdquo; she said, scarcely knowing what she
said.
</p>

<p>
He laughed&mdash;a hard little laugh. &ldquo;Yes, Eva, <i>I</i> am as blind now
as <i>you</i> have been always.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest! Ernest! how can I live without seeing you? <i>I love
you!</i>&rdquo; and she fell into his arms.
</p>

<p>
He kissed her once&mdash;twice, and then somehow, he never knew how, found the
strength to put her from him. Perhaps it was because he heard the servant
coming.
</p>

<p>
Next moment the servant came and led him away. As soon as he was gone Eva flung
herself on to the sofa, and sobbed as though her heart would break.
</p>

<p>
When Dorothy saw a fresh-faced young officer, who had come up to see Ernest,
mysteriously lead him aside, and whisper something in his ear which caused him
to turn first red and then white, being a shrewd observer, she thought it
curious. But when Ernest asked her to ring the bell and then ordered a fly to
be brought round at once, the idea of Eva at once flashed into her mind. She
and no other must be at the bottom of this mystery. Presently the fly was
announced, and Ernest went off without a word, leaving her to the tender
mercies of the cherub, who was contemplating her with his round eye as he had
contemplated Eva, and finding her also charming. It must be remembered that he
had but just returned from South Africa, and was prepared, <i>faute de
mieux,</i> to fall in love with an apple-woman. How much more, then, would he
succumb to the charms of the stately Eva and the extremely fascinating Dorothy!
It was some time before the latter could get rid of his eyeglass. On an
ordinary occasion she would have been glad enough to entertain him, for Dorothy
liked a little male society; and the cherub, though he did look so painfully
young, was not half a bad fellow, and after all his whole soul was in his
eyeglass, and his staring was meant to be complimentary. But just now she had a
purpose in her head, and was heartily glad when he departed to reflect over the
rival attractions of the two charmers.
</p>

<p class="caption">&ldquo;After many days.&rdquo;
</p>
</div>

<p>
It was very evident to Dorothy, who was always strictly practical, that to keep
Eva and Ernest in the same town was to hold dry tow to a lighted match over a
barrel of gun-powder. She only hoped that he might come back now without having
put his foot into it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, what fools men are!&rdquo; she said to herself, with a stamp;
&ldquo;a pretty face and a pair of bright eyes, and they count the world well
lost for them. Bah! if it had been a plain woman who played Ernest that trick,
would he be found dangling about after her now? Not he. But with her, she has
only to say a soft word or two, and he will be at her feet, I&rsquo;ll be
bound. I am ashamed of them both.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Meanwhile she was putting on her bonnet, which was a very favourite time with
her for meditation, having already made up her mind as to her course of action.
Ernest had authorised her to make arrangements for an interview with an
oculist. She proceeded to make those arrangements by telegram, wiring to a
celebrated surgeon to know if he could make an appointment for the following
afternoon. Then she took a walk by herself to think things over. In an hour she
returned, to find Ernest in the sitting-room, looking extremely shaken and
depressed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You have been to see Eva?&rdquo; she said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he answered.
</p>

<p>
Just then there was a knock at the door, and the servant brought in a telegram.
It was from the oculist. He would be glad to see Sir Ernest Kershaw at four
o&rsquo;clock on the following afternoon.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have made an appointment for you with an eye-doctor, Ernest, at four
o&rsquo;clock to morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;To-morrow!&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes. The sooner you get your eyes looked to the better.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He sighed. &ldquo;What is the good? However, I will go.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so next morning they all took the express, and at the appointed time Ernest
found himself in the skilful hands of the oculist. But though an oculist can
mend the sight, he cannot make it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I can do nothing for you, Sir Ernest,&rdquo; he said, after an
exhaustive examination. &ldquo;Your eyes will remain as they are, but you must
always be blind.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest took the news with composure.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I thought as much,&rdquo; he said; but Dorothy put her handkerchief to
her face and wept secretly.
</p>

<p>
Next morning he went with Jeremy to call on Messrs. Paisley and Paisley, and
told them to try and let Archdale Hall, and to lock up the numerous and
valuable heirlooms, as unfortunately he was unable to see them. Then they went
on home to Dum&rsquo;s Ness, and that night Ernest lay awake in the room where
he had slept for so many years in the boyhood which now seemed so dim and
remote, and listened to the stormy wind raving round the house, and thought
with an aching heart of Eva, but was thankful that he had bid her farewell, and
wondered if he could find the strength to keep away from her.
</p>

<p>
And Eva, his lost love, she too lay by the sea and listened to the wind, and
thought on him. There she lay in her beauty, seeking the sleep that would not
settle round her. She could not sleep; forgetful sleep does not come readily to
such as she. For her and those like her are vain regrets and an empty love and
longing, and the wreath of thorns that crowns the brow where sorrow is
enthroned.
</p>

<p>
Yet, Eva, lift that fevered head, and turn those seeking eyes to heaven. See,
through the casement, above the tumult of the storm, there gleams a star. For
you, too, there shines a star called Hope, but it is set in no earthly sky.
Have patience, wayward heart, there is but a space of trouble. As you suffer,
so have millions suffered, and are they not at peace? so shall millions suffer:
</p>

<p class="poem">
&ldquo;While thou, that once didst make the place thou stoodst in lovely, shalt
lie still,<br/>
Thy form departed, and thy face remembered not in good or ill.&rdquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>
For of this we may be sure&mdash;if suffering is not the widest gate of heaven,
then heaven has no gates. Unhappy woman, stretch out those longing arms in
supplication to the God of sorrows for strength to bear your load, since here
it shall not be lightened. The burdens which Providence binds on our backs,
Providence will sometimes lessen, but those which our own folly fastens remain
till death deliver us.
</p>

<p>
So, Eva, dry your tears, for they can avail you naught, and go get you to your
daily task&mdash;go tend your children, and smile that sweet sad smile on all
alike, and <i>wait.</i> As you have sowed so shall you reap, but seed-time is
not done, and not yet is the crop white to the harvest.

HOME AGAIN</h2>

<p>
It was very peaceful, that life at Kesterwick, after all the fierce racket and
excitement of the past years. Indeed, as day succeeded day, and brought nothing
to disturb his darkness but the sound of Dorothy&rsquo;s gentle voice, and the
scent of flowers on the marshes when the wind blew towards the ocean, and the
sharp strong odour of the sea when it set upon the land, Ernest could almost
fancy that the past was nothing but a dream more or less ugly, and that this
was a dream more or less pleasant, from which he should presently wake up and
find himself a boy again.
</p>

<p>
English villages change but little. Now and again a person dies, and pretty
frequently some one is born; but, on the whole, the tide of time creeps on very
imperceptibly, and though in the course of nature the entire population is
changed every sixty years or so, nobody seems to realise that it is changing.
There is so little in such places by which to mark the change. The same
church-tower makes a landmark to the eye as it did centuries ago to the eyes of
our ancestors, and the same clouds sweep across the same blue space above it.
There are the same old houses, the same streams, and, above all, the same roads
and lanes. If you could put one of our Saxon forefathers down in the
neighbourhood of most of our country towns, he would have little difficulty in
finding his way about. It is the men who change, not the places.
</p>

<p>
Still there were some few changes at Kesterwick. Here and there the sea had
taken another bite out of the cliff, notably on the north side of Dum&rsquo;s
Ness, out of which a large slice had gone, thus bringing the water considerably
nearer to the house. Here and there a tree, too, had been cut down, or a
cottage built, or a family changed its residence. For instance, Miss Florence
Ceswick had suddenly shut up the Cottage, where she had remained ever since
Eva&rsquo;s marriage, seeing nothing of her sister or her sister&rsquo;s
husband, and had gone abroad&mdash;people said to Rome, to study art. For
Florence had suddenly electrified the Kesterwick neighbourhood by appearing as
an artist of tragic force and gruesome imagination. A large picture by her hand
had been exhibited in the Royal Academy of the previous year, and, though the
colouring was somewhat crude, it made a great and deserved sensation, and
finally sold for a considerable sum.
</p>

<p>
This picture represented a promontory of land running out far into a stormy
ocean. The sky above the sea was of an inky blackness, except where a fierce
ray of light from a setting sun pierced it, and impinged upon the boiling
waters which surged round the low cliff of the promontory. On the extreme edge
of the cliff stood a tall and lovely woman. The wind caught the white robe she
wore and pressed it against her, revealing the extraordinary beauty of her
form, and, lifting her long fair locks, tossed them in wild confusion. She was
bending forward, pointing with her right hand at the water, with such a look of
ghastly agony upon her beautiful face and in the great gray eyes, that people
of impressionable temperament were wont to declare it haunted their sleep for
weeks. Down below her, just where the fierce ray lit up the heaving waters,
gleamed a naked corpse. It was that of a young man, and was slowly sinking into
the unfathomable darkness of the depths, turning round and round as it sank.
The eyes and mouth were wide open, and the stare of the former appeared to be
fixed upon those of the woman on the cliff. Lastly, over the corpse, in the
storm-wreaths above their heads, there hovered on steady wings a dim female
figure, with its arm thrown across the face as though to hide it. In the
catalogue this picture was called &ldquo;The Lost Lover,&rdquo; but speculation
was rife as to what it meant.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy heard of it, and went to London to see it. The first thing that struck
her about the work was the extraordinary contrast it presented to the
commonplace canvases by which it was surrounded, of reapers, of little girls
frisking with baa-lambs, and nude young women musing profoundly on the edge of
pools, as though they were trying to solve the great question&mdash;to wash or
not to wash. But presently the horror of the picture laid hold upon her, and
seemed to fascinate her, as it had so many others. Then she became aware that
the faces were familiar to her, and suddenly it broke upon her mind that the
sinking corpse was Ernest, and the agonised woman, Eva. She examined the faces
more attentively. There was no doubt about it. Florence, with consummate art,
had changed the colouring of the hair and features, and even to a great extent
altered the features themselves; but she had preserved the likeness perfectly,
both upon the dead face of the murdered man, and in the horror-inspired eyes of
his lover. The picture made her sick with fear&mdash;she could not tell
why&mdash;and she hurried from Burlington House full of dread of the terrible
mind that had conceived it.
</p>

<p>
There had been no intercourse between the two women since Eva&rsquo;s marriage.
Florence lived quite alone at the Cottage, and never went out anywhere; and if
they met by any chance, they passed with a bow. But for all that, it was a
relief to Dorothy to hear that she was not for some long time to see that stern
face with its piercing brown eyes.
</p>

<p>
In Dum&rsquo;s Ness itself there appeared to be no change at all. Except that
Mr. Cardus had built a new orchid-house at the back&mdash;for as he grew older
his mania for orchids increased rather than diminished&mdash;the place was
exactly the same. Even the arrangement of the sitting-room was unchanged, and
on its familiar bracket rested the case which Jeremy had made containing the
witch&rsquo;s head.
</p>

<p>
The people in the house to all appearance had changed as little as the house
itself. Jeremy confided to Ernest that Doll had grown rather
&ldquo;tubby,&rdquo; which was his elegant way of indicating that she had
developed a very pretty figure, and that Grice (the old housekeeper) was as
skinny as a flayed weasel, and had eyes like the point of a knife. Ernest
maliciously repeated these sayings to the two ladies concerned, with the result
that they were both furious. Then he retreated, and left them to settle it with
Jeremy.
</p>

<p>
Old Atterleigh, too, was almost exactly the same, except that of late years his
intellect seemed to have brightened a little. It was, however, difficult to
make him understand that Ernest was blind, because the latter&rsquo;s eyes
looked all right. He retained some recollection of him, and brought him his
notched stick to show him that, according to his (&ldquo;hard-riding
Atterleigh&rsquo;s&rdquo;) calculation, his time of service with the devil,
otherwise Mr. Cardus, would expire in a few months. Dorothy read what the old
man wrote upon his slate, and repeated it to Ernest; for, he being practically
dumb and Ernest being blind, that was the only way in which they could
communicate.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And what will you do then?&rdquo; asked Ernest. &ldquo;You will be
wretched without any writs to fill up. Who will look after the lost souls, I
should like to know?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man at once wrote vigorously on his slate:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I shall go out hunting on the big black horse you brought with you; he
will carry my weight.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should advise you not to try,&rdquo; said Ernest, laughing; &ldquo;he
does not like strange riders.&rdquo; But the old man, at the mere thought of
hunting, was striding up and down the room, clanking his spurs and waving his
hunting crop with his uninjured arm.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Is your grandfather as much afraid of my uncle as ever, Doll?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh yes, I think so; and do you know, Ernest, I don&rsquo;t quite like
the way he looks at him sometimes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed. &ldquo;I should think that the old boy is harmless
enough,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope so,&rdquo; said Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
When first they came back to Dum&rsquo;s Ness, Jeremy was at a great loss to
know what to do with himself, and was haunted by the idea that Mr. Cardus would
want him to resume that stool in his office which years before he had quitted
to go in search of Ernest. A week or so after his arrival, however, his fears
were very pleasantly set at rest. After breakfast, Mr. Cardus sent for him to
come into his office.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Jeremy,&rdquo; he said, letting his soft black eyes wander round
that young gentleman&rsquo;s gigantic form&mdash;for it was by now painfully
large&mdash;not so much in height, for he was not six feet three&mdash;as in
its great width, which made big men look like children beside him, and even
dwarfed his old grandfather&rsquo;s enormous frame&mdash;&ldquo;well, Jeremy,
what do you think of doing? You are too big for a lawyer; all your clients
would be afraid of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know about being too big,&rdquo; said Jeremy, solemnly,
&ldquo;but I know that I am too great an ass. Besides, I can&rsquo;t afford to
spend several years in being articled at my time of life.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Quite so. Then what do you propose doing?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know from Adam.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, how would you like to turn your sword to a plough-share, and
become a farmer?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that would suit me first-rate. I have some capital laid by.
Ernest and I made a little money out there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I would not advise you to take a farm in that way; these are bad
times. But I want a practical man to look after my land round here&mdash;salary
&pound;150. What do you say?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are very kind; but I doubt if I can boss that coach; I don&rsquo;t
know anything of the work.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, you will very soon learn; there is a capital bailiff;
Stamp&mdash;you remember him&mdash;he will soon put you up to the ropes. So we
will consider that settled.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Thus it was that our friend Jeremy entered on a new walk in life, and one which
suited him very well. In less than a year&rsquo;s time he grew aggressively
agricultural, and one never met him but what he had a handful of oats, or a
mangel-wurzel in his coat-tail pocket, which he was ready to swear were samples
of the finest oats, mangel-wurzel, or whatever the particular agricultural
product might be that ever had been, or were ever likely to be, grown.

<h2><a name="chap42"></a>CHAPTER VI.<br/>
HOW IT ALL CAME ABOUT</h2>

<p>
How did it all come about?
</p>

<p>
Let us try and discover. Dorothy and Ernest were together all day long. They
only separated when Mazooku came to lead the latter off to bed. At
breakfast-time he led him back again, and handed him over to Dorothy for the
day. Not that our Zulu friend liked this; he did not like it at all. It was, he
considered, his business to lead his master about, and not that of the
&ldquo;Rosebud,&rdquo; who was, as he discovered, after all nothing but a girl
connected with his master neither by birth nor marriage. And on this point
there finally arose a difference of opinion between the Rosebud and Mazooku.
</p>

<p>
The latter was leading Ernest for his morning walk, when Dorothy, perceiving
it, and being very jealous of what she considered her rights, sallied out and
took his hand from the great Zulu&rsquo;s. Then did Mazooku&rsquo;s long-pent
indignation break forth.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Rosebud, sweet and small Rosebud!&rdquo; he commenced, addressing her
in Zulu, of which, needless to say, she understood not one word, &ldquo;why do
you come and take my father&rsquo;s hand out of my hand? Is not Mazimba my
father blind, and am I not his dog, his old dog, to lead him in his blindness?
Why do you take his bone from a dog?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is the man saying?&rdquo; asked Dorothy.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is offended because you come to lead me; he says that he is my dog,
and that you snatch his bone from him: A pretty sort of bone indeed!&rdquo; he
added.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him,&rdquo; said Dorothy, &ldquo;that here in this country I hold
your hand. What does he want? Is he not always with you? Does he not sleep
across your door? What more does he want?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest translated her reply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ow!&rdquo; said the Zulu, with a grunt of dissatisfaction.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;He is a faithful fellow, Doll, and has stood by me for many years; you
must not vex him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
But Dorothy, after the manner of loving women, was tenacious of what she
considered <i>her</i> rights.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Tell him that he can walk in front,&rdquo; she said, putting on an
obstinate little look&mdash;and she could look obstinate when she liked.
&ldquo;Besides,&rdquo; she added, &ldquo;he cannot be trusted to lead you. I am
sure he was tipsy last night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest translated the first remark only&mdash;into the latter he did not care
to inquire, for the Zulu vowed that he could never understand Dorothy&rsquo;s
English, and Mazooku accepted the compromise. Thus for awhile the difference
was patched up.
</p>

<p>
Sometimes Dorothy and Ernest would go out riding together; for, blind as he
was, Ernest could not be persuaded to give up his riding. It was a pretty sight
to see them; Ernest mounted on his towering black stallion, &ldquo;The
Devil,&rdquo; which in his hands was as gentle as a lamb, but with everybody
else fully justified his appellation, and Dorothy on a cream-coloured cob Mr.
Cardus had given her, holding in her right hand a steel guiding-rein linked to
&ldquo;The Devil&rsquo;s&rdquo; bit. In this way they would wander all over the
country-side, and sometimes, when a good piece of turf presented itself, even
venture on a sharp canter. Behind them Mazooku rode as groom, mounted on a
stout pony, with his feet stuck, Zulu fashion, well out at right-angles to his
animal&rsquo;s side.
</p>

<p>
They were a strange trio.
</p>

<p>
And so from week&rsquo;s end to week&rsquo;s end Dorothy was ever by
Ernest&rsquo;s side, reading to him, writing for him, walking and riding with
him, weaving herself into the substance of his life.
</p>

<p>
And at last there came one sunny August day, when they were sitting together in
the shade of the chancel of Titheburgh Abbey. It was a favourite spot of
theirs, for the gray old walls sheltered them from the glare of the sun and the
breath of the winds. It was a spot, too, rich in memories of the dead past, and
a pleasant place to sit.
</p>

<p>
Through the gaping window-places came the murmur of the ocean and the warmth of
the harvest sunshine; and gazing out by the chancel doorway, Dorothy could see
the long lights of the afternoon dance and sparkle on the emerald waves.
</p>

<p>
She had been reading to him, and the book lay idle on her knees as she gazed
dreamily at those lights and shadows, a sweet picture of pensive womanhood. He,
too, had relapsed into silence, and was evidently thinking deeply.
</p>

<p>
Presently she roused herself.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Ernest,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;what are you thinking about? You
are as dull as&mdash;as the dullest thing in the world, whatever that may be.
What is the dullest thing in the world?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t know,&rdquo; he answered, awakening. &ldquo;Yes, I think I
do; an American novel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, that is a good definition. You are as dull as an American
novel.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is unkind of you to say so, Doll, my dear. I was thinking of
something, Doll.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She made a little face, which of course he could not see, and answered quickly:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You generally are thinking of something. You generally are thinking
of&mdash;Eva, except when you are asleep, and then you are dreaming of
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest coloured up.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is true; she is often more or less in my
mind. It is my misfortune, Doll, not my fault. You see, I do not do things by
halves.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy bit her lip.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;She should be vastly flattered, I am sure. Few women can boast of having
inspired such affection in a man. I suppose it is because she treated you so
badly. Dogs love the hand that whips them. You are a curious character, Ernest.
Not many men would give so much to one who has returned so little.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much the better for them. If I had a son, I think that I should teach
him to make love to all women, and to use their affection as a means of
amusement and self-advancement, but to fall in love with none.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That is one of your bitter remarks, for which I suppose we must thank
Eva. You are always making them now. Let me tell you that there are good women
in the world; yes, and honest, faithful women, who, when they have given their
heart, are true to their choice, and would not do it violence to be made Queen
of England. But you men do not go the right way to find them. You think of
nothing but beauty, and never take the trouble to learn the hearts of the sweet
girls who grow like daisies in the grass all round you, but who do not happen
to have great melting eyes or a splendid figure. You tread them underfoot, and
if they were not so humble they would be crushed, as you rush off and try to
pick the rose; and then you prick your fingers and cry out, and tell all the
daisies how shamefully the rose has treated you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed, and Dorothy went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, it is an unjust world. Let a woman but be beautiful and everything
is at her feet, for you men are despicable creatures, and care for little
except what is pleasant to the senses. On the other hand, let her be plain, or
only ordinary-looking&mdash;for the fate of most of us is just to escape being
ugly&mdash;and you pay as much regard to her as you do to the chairs you sit
on. And yet, strange as it may seem to you, probably she has her feelings, and
her capacities for high affection, and her imaginative power, all working
vigorously behind her plain little face. Probably, too, she is better than your
beauty. Nature does not give everything. When she endows a woman with perfect
loveliness, she robs her either of her heart or her brains. But you men
don&rsquo;t see that, because you won&rsquo;t look; so in course of time all
the fine possibilities in Miss Plainface wither up, and she becomes a
disappointed old maid, while my Lady Beauty pursues her career of selfishness
and mischief-making, till at last she withers up too, that&rsquo;s one comfort.
We all end in bones, you know, and there isn&rsquo;t much difference between us
then.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest had been listening with great amusement to Dorothy&rsquo;s views. He had
no idea that she took such matters into her shrewd consideration.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I heard a girl say the other day that, on the whole, most women
preferred to become old maids,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then she told fibs; they don&rsquo;t. It isn&rsquo;t natural that they
should&mdash;that is, if they care for anybody. Just think, there are more than
ten hundred thousand of our charming sisterhood in these islands, and more
women being born every day! Ten hundred thousand restless, unoccupied,
disgusted, loveless women! It is simply awful to think of. I wonder they
don&rsquo;t breed a revolution. If they were all beautiful, they would.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He laughed again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Do you know what remedy Mazooku would apply to this state of
affairs?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;The instant adoption of polygamy. There are no unmarried women among the
Natal Zulus, and as a class they are extremely happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy shook her head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It wouldn&rsquo;t do here; it would be too expensive.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I say, Doll, you spoke just now of our &lsquo;charming
sisterhood&rsquo;; you are rather young to consider yourself an old maid. Do
you want to become one?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; she said sharply.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then <i>you</i> don&rsquo;t care for anybody, eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She blushed up furiously.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What business is that of yours, I should like to know?&rdquo; she
answered.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Doll, not much. But will you be angry with me if I say
something?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I suppose you can say what you like.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; but will you listen?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If you speak I cannot help hearing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, then, Doll&mdash;now don&rsquo;t be angry, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Ernest, how you aggravate me! Can&rsquo;t you get it out and have done
with it?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, Doll, I&rsquo;ll steam straight ahead this time. It is this.
I have sometimes lately been vain enough to think that you cared a little about
me, Doll, although I am as blind as a bat. I want to ask you if it is true. You
must tell me plain, Doll, because I cannot see your eyes to learn the truth
from them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She turned quite pale at his words, and her eyes rested upon his blind orbs
with a look of unutterable tenderness. So it had come at last.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you ask me that question. Ernest? Whether or no I care for you, I
am very sure that you do not care for me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You are not quite right there, Doll, but I will tell you why I ask it;
it is not out of mere curiosity.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You know all the history of my life, Doll, or at least most of it. You
know how I loved Eva, and gave her all that a foolish youngster can give to a
weak woman&mdash;gave it in such a way that I can never have it back again.
Well, she deserted me; I have lost her. The best happiness of my life has been
wrecked beyond redemption; that is a fact which must be accepted as much as the
fact of my blindness. I am physically and morally crippled, and certainly in no
fit state to ask a woman to marry me on the ground of my personal advantages.
But if, my dear Doll, you should, as I have sometimes thought, happen to care
about anything so worthless, then, you see, the affair assumes a different
aspect.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t quite understand you. What do you mean?&rdquo; she said,
in a low voice.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I mean that in that case I will ask you if you will take me for a
husband.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You do not love me, Ernest; I should weary you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He felt for her hand, found it, and took it in his own. She made no resistance.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;it is this way: I can never give you that
passion I gave to Eva, because, thank God, the human heart can know it but once
in a life; but I can and will give you a husband&rsquo;s tenderest love. You
are very dear to me, Doll, though it is not in the same way that Eva is dear. I
have always loved you as a sister, and I think that I should make you a good
husband. But, before you answer me, I want you to thoroughly understand about
Eva. Whether I marry or not, I fear that I shall never be able to shake her out
of my mind. At one time I thought that perhaps if I made love to other women I
might be able to do so, on the principle that one nail drives out another. But
it was a failure; for a month or two I got the better of my thoughts, then they
would get the better of me again. Besides, to tell you the truth, I am not
quite sure that I wish to do so. My trouble about this woman has become a part
of myself. It is, as I told you, my &lsquo;evil destiny,&rsquo; and goes where
I go. And now, dear Doll, you will see why I asked you if you really cared for
me before I asked you to marry me. If you do not care for me, then it will
clearly not be worth your while to marry me, for I am about as poor a catch as
a man can well be; if you do&mdash;well, then it is a matter for your
consideration.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She paused awhile and answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Suppose that the positions were reversed, Ernest; at least, suppose
this: suppose that you had loved your Eva all your life, but she had not loved
you except as a brother, having given her heart to some other man, who was,
say, married to somebody else, or in some way separated from her. Well,
supposing that this man died, and that one day Eva came to you and said,
&lsquo;Ernest, my dear, I cannot love you as I loved him who has gone, and whom
I one day hope to rejoin in heaven; but if you wish it, and it will make you
the happier, I will be your true and tender wife.&rsquo; What should you answer
her, Ernest?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Answer? why, I suppose that I should take her at her word and be
thankful. Yes, I think that I should take her at her word.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so, dear Ernest, do I take you at your word; for as it is with you
about Eva, so it is with me about you. As a child I loved you; ever since I
have been a woman I have loved you more and more, even through all those cold
years of absence. And when you came back, ah, then il was to me as it would be
to you if you suddenly once more saw the light of day. Ernest, my beloved, you
are all my life to me, and I take you at your word, my dear. I will be your
wife.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He stretched out his arms, found her, drew her to him, and kissed her on the
lips.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll, I don&rsquo;t deserve that you should love me so; it makes me feel
ashamed that I have not more to give you in return.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, you will give me all you can; I mean to make you grow very fond
of me. Perhaps one day you will give me everything.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He hesitated a little while before he spoke again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are quite sure that you do not mind
about Eva?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear Ernest, I accept Eva as a fact, and make the best of her, just
as I should if I wanted to marry a man with a monomania that he was Henry
VIII.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Doll, you know I call her my evil destiny. The fact is, I am afraid of
her; she overpowers my reason. Well, now, Doll, what I am driving at is this:
supposing&mdash;not that I think she will&mdash;that she were to crop up again,
and take it into her head to try and make a fool of me! She <i>might</i> succeed,
Doll.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, will you promise me something on your honour?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Promise me that you will hide from me nothing that passes between Eva
and yourself, if anything ever should pass, and that in this matter you will
always consider me not in the light of a wife, but of a trusted friend.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why do you ask me to promise that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because then I shall, I hope, be able to keep you both out of trouble.
You are not fit to look after yourselves, either of you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I promise. And now, Doll, there is one more thing. It is somehow fixed
in my mind that my fate and that woman&rsquo;s are intertwined. I believe that
what we are now passing through is but a single phase of interwoven existence;
that we have, perhaps, already passed through many stages, and that many higher
stages and developments await us. Of course, it may be fantasy, but at any rate
I believe it. The question is, do you care to link your life with that of a man
who holds such a belief?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest, I daresay your belief is a true one, at any rate for you who
believe it, for it seems probable that as we sow so shall we reap, as we
spiritually imagine so shall we spiritually inherit, since causes must in time
produce effects. These beliefs are not implanted in our hearts for nothing, and
surely in the wide heavens there is room for the realisation of them all. But I
too have my beliefs, and one of them is, that in God&rsquo;s great Hereafter
every loving and desiring soul will be with the soul thus loved and desired.
For him or her, at any rate, the other will be there, forming a part of his or
her life, though, perhaps, it may elsewhere and with others also be pursuing
its own desires and satisfying its own aspirations. So you see, Ernest, your
beliefs will not interfere with mine, nor shall I be afraid of losing you in
another place.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And now, Ernest, my heart&rsquo;s love, take my hand, and let me
lead you home; take my hand, as you have taken my heart, and never leave go of
it again till at last I die.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so hand in hand they went home together, through the lights and shadows of
the twilight.

<h2><a name="chap43"></a>CHAPTER VII.<br/>
MAZOOKU&rsquo;S FAREWELL</h2>

<p>
Dorothy and Ernest got back to Dum&rsquo;s Ness just in time to dress for
dinner, for since Ernest and Jeremy had come back, Dorothy, whose will in that
house was law, had instituted late dinner. The dinner passed over as usual,
Dorothy sitting between Ernest and her grandfather, and attending to the wants
of those two unfortunates, both of whom would have found it rather difficult to
get through their meal without her gentle, unobtrusive help. But when dinner
was over and the cloth removed, and Grice had placed the wine upon the table
and withdrawn, an unusual thing happened.
</p>

<p>
Ernest asked Dorothy to fill his glass with port, and when she had done so he
said:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Uncle and Jeremy, I am going to ask you to drink a health.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man looked up sharply. &ldquo;What is it, Ernest, my boy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
As for Dorothy, she blushed a rosy red, guessing what was coming, and not
knowing whether to be pleased or angry.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It is this, uncle&mdash;it is the health of my future wife,
Dorothy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then came a silence of astonishment. Mr. Cardus broke it:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Years ago, Ernest, my dear nephew, I told you that I wished this to come
to pass; but other things happened to thwart my plans, and I never expected to
see it. Now in God&rsquo;s good time it has come, and I drink the health with
all my heart. My children, I know that I am a strange man, and my life has been
devoted to a single end, which is now drawing near its final development; but I
have found time in it to learn to love you both. Dorothy, my daughter, I drink
your health. May the happiness that was denied to your mother fall upon your
head, her share and your share too! Ernest, you have passed through many
troubles, and have been preserved almost miraculously to see this day. In
Dorothy you will find a reward for everything, for she is a good woman. Perhaps
I shall never live to see your happiness and the children of your
happiness&mdash;I do not think I shall; but may the solemn blessing I give you
now rest upon your dear heads! God bless you both, my children. All peace go
with you, Dorothy and Ernest!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; said Jeremy, in a loud voice, and with a vague idea that he
was in church. Then he got up and shook Ernest&rsquo;s hand so hard in his
fearful grip that the latter was constrained to holloa out, and lifted Dolly
out of her chair like a plaything, and kissed her boisterously, knocking the
orchid-bloom she wore out of her hair in the process. Then they all sat down
again and beamed at one another and drank port-wine&mdash;at least the men
did&mdash;and were inanely happy.
</p>

<p>
Indeed, the only person to whom the news was not satisfactory was Mazooku.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ou!&rdquo; he said, with a grunt, when Jeremy communicated it to him.
&ldquo;So the Rosebud is going to become the Rose, and I shan&rsquo;t even be
able to lead my father to bed now. Ou!&rdquo; And from that day forward
Mazooku&rsquo;s abstracted appearance showed that he was meditating deeply on
something.
</p>

<p>
Next morning his uncle sent for Ernest into the office. Dorothy led him in.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O, here you are!&rdquo; said his uncle.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, here we are, Reginald,&rdquo; answered Dorothy; &ldquo;what is it?
Shall I go away?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, don&rsquo;t go away. What I have to say concerns you both. Come and
look at the orchids, Ernest; they are beautiful. Ah!&rdquo; he went on,
stammering, &ldquo;I forgot you can&rsquo;t see them. Forgive me.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Never mind, uncle, I can smell them;&rdquo; and they went into the
blooming-house appropriated to the temperate kinds.
</p>

<p>
At the end of this house was a little table and some iron chairs, where Mr.
Cardus would sometimes come and smoke a cigarette. Here they sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, young people,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, wiping his bald head,
&ldquo;you are going to get married. May I ask what you are going to get
married on?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By Jove,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;I never thought of that! I
haven&rsquo;t got much, except a title, a mansion with &lsquo;numerous and
valuable&rsquo; heirlooms, and one hundred and eighty acres of park,&rdquo; he
added, laughing.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, I don&rsquo;t suppose you have; but, luckily for you both, I am not
so badly off, and I mean to do something for you. What do you think would be
the proper thing? Come, Dorothy, my little housewife, what do you reckon you
can live on&mdash;living here, I mean, for I suppose that you do not mean to
run away and leave me alone in my old age, do you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy wrinkled up her forehead as she used to as a child, and began to
calculate upon her fingers. Presently she answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Three hundred a year comfortably, quietly on two.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What!&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;when the babies begin to
come?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy blushed, old gentlemen are so unpleasantly out-spoken, and Ernest
jumped, for the prospect of unlimited babies is alarming till one gets used to
it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Better make it five hundred,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;that&rsquo;s what you think, is it?
Well, I tell you what I think. I am going to allow you young people two
thousand a year and pay the housekeeping bills.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;My dear uncle, that is far more than we want.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, Ernest! it is there and to spare; and why should you not have
it, instead of its piling up in the bank or in investments? There are enough of
them now, I can tell you. Everything that I have touched has turned to gold; I
believe it has often been the case with unfortunate men. Money! I have more
than I know what to do with, and there are idiots who think that to have lots
of money is to be happy.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused awhile and then went on:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I would give you more, but you are both comparatively young, and I do
not wish to encourage habits of extravagance in you. The world is full of
vicissitudes, and it is impossible for anybody to know how he may be
pecuniarily situated in ten years&rsquo; time. But I wish you, Ernest, to keep
up your rank&mdash;moderately, if you like, but still to keep it up. Life is
all before you now, and whatever you choose to go in for, you shall not want
the money to back you. Look here, my children, I may as well tell you that when
I die you will inherit nearly all I have got; I have left it to be divided
equally between you, with reversion to the survivor. I drew up that will some
years back, and I do not think that it is worth while altering it now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive me,&rdquo; said Ernest, &ldquo;but how about Jeremy?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s face changed a little. He had never got over his dislike of
Jeremy, though his sense of justice caused him to stifle it.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have not forgotten Jeremy,&rdquo; he said, in a tone that indicated
that he did not wish to pursue the conversation.
</p>

<p>
Ernest and Dorothy thanked the old man for his goodness, but he would not
listen, so they went off and left him to return to his letter-writing. In the
passage Dorothy peeped through the glass half of the door which opened into her
grandfather&rsquo;s room.
</p>

<p>
There sat the old man writing, writing, his long iron-gray hair hanging all
about his face. Presently he seemed to think of something, and a smile, which
the contorted mouth made ghastly, spread itself over the pallid countenance.
Rising, he went to the corner and extracted a long tally-stick on which notches
were cut. Sitting down again, he counted the remaining notches over and over,
and then took a penknife and cut one out. This done, he put the stick back,
and, looking at the wall, began to mutter&mdash;for he was not quite
dumb&mdash;and to clasp and unclasp his powerful hand. Dorothy entered the room
quickly.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather, what are you doing?&rdquo; she said sharply.
</p>

<p>
The old man started, and his jaw dropped. Then the eyes grew dull, and his
usual apathetic look stole over his face. Taking up his slate, he wrote,
&ldquo;Cutting out my notches.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Dorothy asked him some farther questions, but could get nothing more out of
him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t at all like the way grandfather has been going on
lately,&rdquo; she said to Ernest. &ldquo;He is always muttering and clinching
his hand, as though he had some one by the throat. You know he thinks that he
has been serving the fiend all these years, and that his time will be up
shortly, whereas you know, though Reginald had no cause to love him, he has
been very kind to him. If it had not been for Reginald, my grandfather would
have been sent to the madhouse; but because he was connected with his loss of
fortune, he thinks he is the devil. He forgets how he served Reginald; you see
even in madness the mind only remembers the injuries inflicted on itself, and
forgets those it inflicted on others. I don&rsquo;t at all like his way.&rdquo;
&ldquo;I should think that he had better be shut up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Reginald would never do it. Come, dear, let us go out.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
It was a month or so after Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s announcement of his pecuniary
intentions that a little wedding-party stood before the altar in Kesterwick
Church. It was a very small party, consisting, indeed, only of Ernest, Dorothy,
Mr. Cardus, Jeremy, and a few idlers, who, seeing the church door open, had
strolled in to see what was going on. Indeed, the marriage had been kept a
profound secret; for since he had been blind, Ernest had developed a great
dislike to being stared at. Nor, indeed, had he any liking for the system under
which a woman proclaims with loud and unseemly rejoicings that she has found a
man to marry her, and the clan of her relations celebrate her departure with a
few outward and visible tears and much inward and spiritual joy.
</p>

<p>
But among that small crowd, unobserved by any of them, quite close up in the
shadow of one of the massive pillars, sat a veiled woman. She sat quite quiet
and still; she might have been carved in stone; but as the service went on she
raised her thick veil, and fixed her keen brown eyes upon the two who stood
before the altar. And as she did so, the lips of this shadowy lady trembled a
little, and a mist of trouble rose from the unhealthy marshes of her mind and
clouded her fine cut features. Long and steadily she gazed, then dropped the
veil again, and said beneath her breath:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Was it worth while for this? Well, I have seen him.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Then this shadowy noble-looking lady rose, and glided from the church, bearing
away with her the daunting burden of her sin.
</p>

<p>
And Ernest? He stood there and said the responses in his clear manly voice; but
even as he did so there rose before him the semblance of the little room in
faraway Pretoria, and of the vision which he had had of this very church, and
of a man standing where he himself stood now, and a lovely woman standing where
stood Dorothy his wife. Well, it was gone, as all visions go&mdash;as we, who
are but visions of a longer life, go too. It was gone&mdash;gone into that
limbo of the past which is ever opening its insatiable maw and swallowing us
and our joys and our sorrows&mdash;making a meal of the atoms of to-day that it
may support itself till the atoms of to-morrow are ready for its appetite.
</p>

<p>
It was gone, and he was married, and Dorothy his wife stood there wreathed in
smiles and blushes which he could not see, and Mr. Halford&rsquo;s voice, now
grown weak and quavering, was formulating heartfelt congratulations, which were
being repeated in the gigantic echo of Jeremy&rsquo;s deep tones, and in his
uncle&rsquo;s quick jerky utterances. So he took Dorothy his wife into his arms
and kissed her, and she led him down the church to the old vestry, into which
so many thousand newly married couples had passed during the course of the last
six centuries, and he signed his name where they placed his pen upon the
parchment, wondering the while if he was signing it straight, and then went
out, and was helped into the carriage, and driven home.
</p>

<p>
Ernest and his wife went upon no honeymoon; they stopped quietly there at the
old house, and began to accustom themselves to their new relationship. Indeed,
to the outsider at any rate, there seemed to be little difference between it
and the former one; for they could not be much more together now than they had
been before. Yet in Dorothy&rsquo;s face there was a difference. A great peace,
an utter satisfaction which had been wanting before, came down and brooded upon
it, and made it beautiful. She both looked and was a happy woman.
</p>

<p>
But to the Zulu Mazooku this state of affairs did not appear to be
satisfactory.
</p>

<p>
One day&mdash;it was three days after the marriage&mdash;Ernest and Dorothy
were walking together outside the house, when Jeremy, coming in from a visit to
a distant farm, advanced, and, joining them, began to converse on agricultural
matters; for he was already becoming intensely and annoyingly technical.
Presently, as they talked, they became aware of the sound of naked feet running
swiftly over the grass.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That sounds like a Zulu dancing,&rdquo; said Ernest, quickly.
</p>

<p>
It was a Zulu; it was Mazooku, but Mazooku transformed. It had been his fancy
to bring a suit of war finery, such as he had worn when he was one of
Cetywayo&rsquo;s soldiers, with him from Natal; and now he had donned it all,
and stood before them, a striking yet alarming figure. From his head a single
beautiful gray feather, taken from the Bell crane, rose a good two feet into
the air; around his waist hung a kilt of white ox-tails, and beneath his right
knee and shoulder were small circles of white goat&rsquo;s hair. For the rest,
he was naked. In his left hand he held a milk-white fighting shield made of
ox-hide, and in his right his great &ldquo;bangwan,&rdquo; or stabbing assegai.
Still as a statue he stood before them, his plume bending in the breeze; and
Dorothy, looking with wondering eyes, marvelled at the broad chest scarred all
over with assegai wounds, and the huge sinewy limbs. Suddenly he raised the
spear, and saluted in sonorous tones:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Koos! Baba!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Speak,&rdquo; said Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I speak, Mazimba, my father. I come to meet my father as a man meets a
man. I come with spear and shield, but not in war. With my father I came from
the land of the sun into this cold land, where the sun is as pale as the white
faces it shines on. Is it not so, my father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear you.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;With my father I came. Did not my father and I stand together for many a
day? Did I not slay the two Basutus down in the land of Secocoeni, chief of the
Bapedi, at my father&rsquo;s bidding? Did I not once save my father from the
jaws of the wild beast that walks by night&mdash;from the fangs of the lion?
Did I not stand by the side of my father at the place of the Little Hand, when
all the plain of Isandhlwana was red with blood? Do I dream in the night, or
was it so, my father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hear you. It was so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then when the heavens above smelt out my father, and smote him with
their fire, did I not say, &lsquo;Ah, my father, now art thou blind, and canst
fight no more, and no more play the part of a man. Better that thou hadst died
a man&rsquo;s death, O my father! But as thou art blind, lo! whither thou
goest, thither will I go also and be my father&rsquo;s dog.&rsquo; Did I not
say this, O Mazimba, my father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou didst say it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so we sailed across the black water, thou Mazimba and I and the
great Lion, like unto whom no man was ever born of woman, and came hither, and
have lived for many moons the lives of women, have eaten and drunken, and have
not fought or hunted, or known the pleasure of men. Is it not so,
Mazimba, my father?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thou speakest truly, Mazooku; it is even so.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, we sailed across the black water in the smoking ship, sailed to the
land of wonders, which is full of houses and trees, so that a man cannot
breathe in it, or throw out his arms lest they should strike a wall; and,
behold! there came an ancient one with a shining head wonderful to look on, and
a girl Rosebud, small but very sweet, and greeted my father and the Lion, and
led them away in the carriages which put the horses inside them, and set them
in this place, where they may look for ever at the sadness of the sea.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And then, behold, the Rosebud said, &lsquo;What doth this black dog
here? Shall a dog lead Mazimba by the hand? Begone, thou black dog, and walk in
front or ride behind; it is I who will hold Mazimba&rsquo;s hand.&rsquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then my father, sinking deep in ease, and becoming a fat man, rich in
oxen and waggons and corn, said to himself, &lsquo;I will take this Rosebud to
wife.&rsquo; And so the Rosebud opened her petals, and closed them round my
father, and became a Rose; and now she sheds her fragrance round him day by day
and night by night, and the black dog stands and howls outside the door.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And so, my father, it came to pass that Mazooku, thy ox and thy dog,
communed with his heart, and said: &lsquo;Here is no more any place for thee.
Mazimba thy chief has no longer any need of thee, and behold in this land of
women thou, too, shalt grow like a woman. So get up and go to thy father, and
say to him, &ldquo;O my father, years ago I put my hand between thy hands, and
became a loyal man to thee; now I would withdraw it, and return to the land
whence we came; for here I am not wanted, and here I cannot
breathe.&rdquo;&rsquo; I have spoken, O my father and my chief.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mazooku, umdanda ga Ingoluvu, umfana ga Amazulu&rdquo; (son of Ingoluvu,
child of the Zulu race), answered Ernest, adopting the Zulu metaphor, his voice
sounding wonderfully soft as the liquid tongue he spoke so well came rolling
out, &ldquo;thou hast been a good man to me, and I have loved thee. But thou
shalt go. Thou art right: now is my life the life of a woman; never again shall
I hear the sound of the rifle or the ringing of steel in war. And so thou
goest, Mazooku. It is well. But at times thou wilt think of thy blind master
Mazimba, and of Alston, the wise captain who sleeps, and of the Lion who threw
the ox over his shoulder. Go, and be happy. Many be thy wives, many thy
children, and countless thy cattle! The Lion shall take thee by the hand and
lead thee to the sea, and shall give thee of my bounty wherewith to buy a
little food when thou comest to thine own land, and a few oxen, and a piece of
ground, or a waggon or two, so that thou shalt not be hungry, nor want for
cattle to give for wives. Mazooku, fare thee well!&rdquo;
</p>

<p class="caption">Mazooku&rsquo;s Farewell.
</p>
</div>

<p>
&ldquo;One word, Mazimba, my father, and I will trouble thine ears no more,
since for thee my voice shall be silent for ever. When the time has come for
thee to die, and thou dost pass, as the white men say, up &lsquo;into the
heavens above,&rsquo; and thy sight dawns again, and thou art once more a man
eager for battle, then turn thee and cry with a loud voice: &lsquo;Mazooku, son
of Ingoluvu, of the tribe of the Maquilisini, where art thou, O my dog? Come
thou and serve me!&rsquo; And surely, if I still live, then shall I hear thy
voice, and groan and die, that I may pass to thee; and if I be already dead,
then shall I be there at thy side even as thou callest. This thou wilt do for
me, O Mazimba, my father and my chief, because, lo! I have loved thee as the
child loves her who suckled it, and I would look upon thy face again, O my
father from the olden time, my chief from generation to generation!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;If it be in my power, this I will do, Mazooku.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The great Zulu drew himself up, raised his spear, and for the first and last
time in his life gave Ernest the royal salute&mdash;to which, by the way, he
had no right at all&mdash;&ldquo;<i>Bayte, Bayte!</i>&rdquo; Then he turned
and ran swiftly thence, nor would he see Ernest again before he went.
&ldquo;The pain of death was over,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
As the sound of his footsteps grew faint, Ernest sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There goes our last link with South Africa, Jeremy, my boy. It is a good
thing, for he was growing too fond of the bottle; they all do here. But it
makes me very sad, and sometimes I think that, as Mazooku says, it is a pity we
did not go under with Alston and the others. It would all have been over
now.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Thank you,&rdquo; said Jeremy, after reflecting; &ldquo;on the whole, I
am pretty comfortable as I am.&rdquo;

<h2><a name="chap44"></a>CHAPTER VIII.<br/>
MR. CARDUS ACCOMPLISHES HIS REVENGE</h2>

<p>
Mr. de Talor owed his great wealth not to his own talents, but to a lucky
secret in the manufacture of the grease used on railways discovered by his
father. Talor <i>pre</i> had been a railway-guard till his discovery brought
him wealth. He was a shrewd man, however, and on his sudden accession of
fortune did his best to make a gentleman of his only son, at that date a lad of
fifteen. But it was too late; the associations and habits of childhood are not
easily overcome, and no earthly power or education could accomplish the desired
object. When his son was twenty years of age, old Jack Talor died, and his son
succeeded to his large fortune and a railway-grease business which supplied the
principal markets of the world.
</p>

<p>
This son had inherited a good deal of his father&rsquo;s shrewdness, and set
himself to make the best of his advantages. First he placed a &ldquo;de&rdquo;
before his name, and assumed a canting crest. Next he bought the Ceswick Ness
estates, and bloomed into a country gentleman. It was shortly after this latter
event that he made a mistake, and fell in love with the beauty of the
neighbourhood, Mary Atterleigh. But Mary Atterleigh would have none of him,
being at the time secretly engaged to Mr. Cardus. In vain did he resort to
every possible means to shake her resolution, even going so far as to try to
bribe her father to put pressure upon her; but at this time old Atterleigh,
&ldquo;Hard-riding Atterleigh,&rdquo; as he was called, was well off, and
resisted his advances, whereupon De Talor, in a fit of pique, married another
woman, who was only too glad to put up with his vulgarity in consideration of
his wealth and position as a county magnate.
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards three events occurred almost simultaneously.
&ldquo;Hard-riding Atterleigh&rdquo; got into money difficulties through
over-gratification of his passion for hounds and horses; Mr. Cardus was taken
abroad for the best part of a year in connection with a business matter and a
man named Jones, a friend of Mr. de Talor&rsquo;s staying in his house at the
time, fell in love with Mary Atterleigh. Herein De Talor saw an opportunity of
revenge upon his rival, Mr. Cardus. He urged upon Jones that his real road to
the possession of the lady lay through the pocket of her father, and even went
so far as to advance him the necessary funds to bribe Atterleigh; for though
Jones was well off, he could not at such short notice lay hands upon a
sufficient sum in cash to serve his ends.
</p>

<p>
The plot succeeded. Atterleigh&rsquo;s scruples were overcome as easily as the
scruples of men in his position without principle to back them generally are,
and pressure of a most outrageous sort was brought to bear upon the
gentle-minded Mary, with the result that when Mr. Cardus returned from abroad
he found his affianced bride the wife of another man, who became in due course
the father of Jeremy and Dolly.
</p>

<p>
This cruel and most unexpected bereavement drove Mr. Cardus partially mad, and
when he came to himself there arose in his mind a monomania for revenge on all
concerned in bringing it about. It became the passion and object of his life.
Directing all his remarkable intelligence and energy to the matter, he early
discovered the heinous part that De Talor had played in the plot, and swore to
devote his life to the unholy purpose of avenging it. For years he pursued his
enemy, trying plan after plan to achieve his ruin, and as one failed fell back
upon another. But to ruin a man of De Talor&rsquo;s wealth was no easy matter,
especially when, as in the present instance, the avenger was obliged to work
like a mole in the dark, never allowing his enemy to suspect that he was other
than a friend. How he ultimately achieved his purpose the reader shall now
learn.
</p>

<p>
Ernest and Dorothy had been married about three weeks, and the latter was just
beginning to get accustomed to hearing herself called Lady Kershaw, when one
morning a dogcart drove up to the door, and out of it emerged Mr. de Talor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Dear me, how Mr. de Talor has changed of late!&rdquo; said Dorothy, who
was looking out of the window.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How? Has he grown less like a butcher?&rdquo; asked Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No,&rdquo; she answered; &ldquo;but he looks like a used-up butcher
about to go through the Bankruptcy Court.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Butchers never go bankrupt,&rdquo; said Ernest; and at that moment Mr de
Talor came in.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy was right; the man was much changed. The fat cheeks were flabby and
fallen, the insolent air was gone, and he was so shrunken that he looked not
more than half his former size.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Lady Kershaw? I saw Cardus &rsquo;ad got some one with
him, so I drove round to pay my respects and congratulate the bride. Why, bless
me. Sir Ernest, you &rsquo;ave grown since I saw you last! Ah, we used to be
great friends then. You remember how you used to come and shoot up at the
Ness&rdquo; (he had once or twice given the two lads a day&rsquo;s
rabbit-shooting). &ldquo;But, bless me, I hear that you have become quite a
fire-eater since then, and been knocking over the niggers right and
left&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He paused for breath, and Ernest said a few words, not many, for he disliked
the man&rsquo;s flattery as much as in past years he used to dislike his
insolence.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; went on De Talor, looking up and pointing to the case
containing the witch&rsquo;s head, &ldquo;I see you&rsquo;ve still got that
beastly thing your brother once showed me; I thought it was a clock, and he
pretty well frightened me out of my wits. Now I think of it, I&rsquo;ve never
&rsquo;ad any luck since I saw that thing.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At this moment the housekeeper Grice came to say that Mr. Cardus was ready to
see Mr. de Talor if he would step into the office. Dorothy thought that their
visitor turned paler at this news, and it evidently occupied his mind
sufficiently to cause him to hurry from the room without bidding them good-bye.
</p>

<p>
When Mr. de Talor entered the office he found the lawyer pacing up and down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Cardus?&rdquo; he said jauntily.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;How do you do, Mr. de Talor?&rdquo; was the cold reply.
</p>

<p>
De Talor walked to the glass door and looked at the glowing mass of blooming
orchids.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty flowers, Cardus, those, very. Orchids, ain&rsquo;t they? Must
have cost you a pot of money.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;They have not cost me much, Mr. de Talor; I have reared most of
them.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Then you are lucky; the bill my man gives me for his orchids is
something awful.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You did not come to speak to me about orchids, Mr. de Talor.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;No, Cardus, I didn&rsquo;t; business first, pleasure
afterwards&mdash;eh?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said Mr. Cardus, in his soft, jerky way. &ldquo;Business
first, pleasure afterwards.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor fidgeted his legs about.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Cardus, about that mortgage. You are going to give me a little
more time, I hope?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;On the contrary, Mr. de Talor, the interest being now eight months
overdue, I have given my London agents orders to foreclose, for I don&rsquo;t
conduct such business myself.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
De Talor turned pale. &ldquo;Foreclose! Good God, Cardus! it is not
possible&mdash;on such an old friend too!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Excuse me, it is not only possible, but a fact. Business is business,
even where <i>old friends</i> are concerned.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But if you foreclose, what is to become of me, Cardus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That, I imagine, is a matter for your exclusive consideration.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His visitor gasped, and looked like an unfortunate fish suddenly pulled out of
the water.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Let us recapitulate the facts. I have at different periods within the
last several years lent you sums of money secured on your landed estates at
Ceswick&rsquo;s Ness and the neighbourhood, amounting in
all&rdquo;&mdash;referring to a paper&mdash;&ldquo;to one hundred and
seventy-six thousand five hundred and thirty-eight pounds ten shillings and
fourpence; or, reckoning in the overdue interest, to one hundred and
seventy-nine thousand and fifty-two pounds eight shillings. That is so, I
think.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, I suppose so, Cardus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;There is no supposition about it. The documents prove it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Cardus?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, Mr. de Talor; and now, as you cannot pay, I have instructed my
London agents to commence an action in Chancery for the sale of the lands, and
to buy in the property. It is a most desirable property.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Cardus, don&rsquo;t be rough on me! I am an old man now, and you led
me into this speculation.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mr. de Talor, I also am an old man; if not very old in years, at least
as old as Methuselah in heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t understand it all, Cardus.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It will give me the greatest pleasure to explain. But to do so I must go
back a little. Some ten or twelve years ago, you may remember,&rdquo; he began,
sitting down with his back to the light, which struck full on the wretched De
Talor&rsquo;s face, &ldquo;that a firm named Rastrick and Codley took out a
patent for a new railway-grease, and set up an establishment in Manchester not
far from the famous De Talor house, which was established by your
father.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, curse them!&rdquo; groaned De Talor.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus smiled.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;By all means, curse them. But what did this enterprising firm do, Mr. de
Talor? They set to work, and sold a grease superior to the article manufactured
by your house, at about eighteen per cent. cheaper. But the De Talor house had
the ear of the markets, and the contracts with all the leading lines and
Continental firms, and for awhile it seemed as though the new house must go to
the wall; and if they had not had considerable capital at command, they must
have gone to the wall.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, and where did they get it from? That&rsquo;s the mystery,&rdquo;
said De Talor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Precisely; that was the mystery. I shall clear it up a little presently.
To return. After awhile the buyers began to find that Rastrick and
Codley&rsquo;s grease was a better grease and a cheaper grease, and as the
contracts lapsed, the companies renewed them, not with the De Talor house, but
with the house of Rastrick and Codley. Doubtless you remember.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor groaned in acquiescence, and the lawyer continued: &ldquo;In time
this state of affairs produced its natural results&mdash;De Talor&rsquo;s house
was ruined, and the bulk of the trade fell into the hands of the new
firm.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I should just like to know who they really were&mdash;the low
sneaks!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Would you? I will tell you. The firm of Rastrick and Codley
were&mdash;Reginald Cardus, solicitor, of Dum&rsquo;s Ness.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. de Talor struggled out of his chair, looked wildly at the lawyer, and sank
down again.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You look ill; may I offer you a glass of wine?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The wretched man shook his head.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Very good. Doubtless you are curious to know how I, a lawyer, and not
otherwise connected with Manchester, obtained the monopoly of the grease trade,
which is, by the way, at this moment paying very well. I will satisfy your
curiosity. I have always had a mania for taking up inventions, quite quietly,
and in the names of others. Sometimes I have made money over them, sometimes I
have lost; on the whole, I have made largely. But whether I have made or lost,
the inventors have, as a rule, never known who was backing them. One day, one
lucky day, this railway-grease patent was brought to my notice. I took it up
and invested fifty thousand in it straight off the reel. Then I invested
another fifty thousand. Still your firm cut my throat. I made an effort, and
invested a third fifty thousand. Had I failed, I should then have been a ruined
man; I had strained my credit to the utmost. But fortune favours the brave, Mr.
de Talor, and I succeeded. It was your firm that failed. I have paid all my
debts, and I reckon that the railway-grease concern is worth, after paying
liabilities, some two hundred thousand pounds. If you should care to go in for
it, Messrs. Rastrick and Codley will, I have no doubt, be most happy to treat
with you. It has served its purpose, and is now in the market.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
De Talor looked at him with amazement. He was too upset to speak.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;So much, Mr. de Talor, for my share in the grease episode. The failure
of your firm, or rather its stoppage from loss of trade, left you still a rich
man, but only half as rich as you had been. And this, you may remember, made
you furious. You could not bear the idea of losing money; you would rather have
lost blood from your veins than sovereigns from your purse. When you thought of
the grease which had melted in the fire of competition, you could have wept
tears of rage. In this plight you came to me to ask advice.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes; and you told me to speculate.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not quite accurate, Mr. de Talor. I said&mdash;I remember the words
well&mdash;&lsquo;You are an able man, and understand the money market; why
don&rsquo;t you take advantage of these fluctuating times, and recoup yourself
for all you have lost?&rsquo; The prospect of gain tempted you, Mr. de Talor,
and you jumped at the idea. You asked me to introduce you to a reliable firm,
and I introduced you to Messrs. Campsey and Ash, one of the best in the
City.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Confound them for a set of rogues!&rdquo; answered De Talor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Rogues! I am sorry you think so, for I have an interest in their
business.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Good heavens! what next?&rdquo; groaned De Talor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, notwithstanding the best efforts of Messrs. Campsey and Ash on
your behalf, in pursuance of such written instructions as you from time to time
communicated to them, and to which you can no doubt refer if you please, things
went wrong with you, Mr. de Talor, and year by year, when your balance-sheet
was sent in, you found that you had lost more than you gained. At last, one
unlucky day, about three years ago, you made a plunge against the advice, you
may remember, of Messrs. Campsey and Ash, and lost. It was after that, that I
began to lend you money. The first loan was for fifty thousand; then came more
losses, and more loans, till at length we had reached the present state of
affairs.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;O Cardus, you don&rsquo;t mean to sell me up, do you? What shall I do
without money? And think of my daughters: &rsquo;ow will they manage without
their comforts? Give me time. What makes you so rough on me?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus had been walking up and down the room rapidly. At De Talor&rsquo;s
words he stopped, and going to a despatch-box, unlocked it, and drew from a
bundle of documents a yellow piece of stamped paper. It was a cancelled bill
for ten thousand pounds in the favour of Jonas de Talor, Esquire. This bill he
came and held before his visitor&rsquo;s eyes.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;That, I believe, is your signature,&rdquo; he said quietly, pointing to
the receipt written across the bill.
</p>

<p>
De Talor turned almost livid with fear, and his lips and hands began to
tremble.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Where did you get that?&rdquo; he asked.
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus regarded him, or rather all round him, with the melancholy black
eyes that never looked straight at anything, and yet saw everything, and then
answered:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Among your friend Jones&rsquo;s papers. You scoundrel!&rdquo; he went
on, with a sudden change of manner, &ldquo;now perhaps you begin to understand
why I have hunted you down step by step: why for thirty years I have waited,
and watched, and failed, and at last succeeded. It is for the sake of Mary
Atterleigh. It was you who, infuriated because she would have none of such a
coarse brute, set the man Jones on to her. It was you who lent him the money
with which to buy her from old Atterleigh. There lies the proof before you. By
the way, Jones need never have repaid you that ten thousand pounds, for it was
marriage-brokage, and therefore not recoverable at law. It was you, I say, who
were the first cause of my life being laid waste, and who nearly drove me to
the madhouse, ay, who did drive Mary, my betrothed wife, into the arms of that
fellow, whence, God be praised! she soon passed to her rest.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Mr. Cardus paused, breathing quick with suppressed rage and excitement; the
large white eyebrows contracted till they nearly met, and, abandoning his usual
habit, he looked straight into the eyes of the abject creature in the chair
before him.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a long while ago, Cardus; can&rsquo;t you forgive, and let
bygones be bygones?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Forgive! Yes, for my own sake, I could forgive; but for her sake, whom
you first dishonoured and then killed, I will never forgive. Where are your
companions in guilt? Jones is dead; I ruined him. Atterleigh is there; I did
not ruin him, because, after all, he was the author of Mary&rsquo;s life; but
his ill-gotten gains did him no good; a higher power than mine took vengeance
on his crime, and I saved him from the madhouse. And Jones&rsquo;s children,
they are here too, for once they lay beneath <i>her</i> breast. But do you
think that I will spare you, you coarse arrogant knave&mdash;you, who spawned
the plot? No, not if it were to cost me my own life, would I forego one jot or
tittle of my revenge!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
At that moment Mr. Cardus happened to look up, and saw through the glass part
of the door of his office, of which the curtain was partially drawn, the
wild-looking head of Hard-riding Atterleigh. He appeared to be looking through
the door, for his eyes, in which there was a very peculiar look, were fixed
intently upon Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s face. When he saw that he was observed, he
vanished.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now go,&rdquo; said the lawyer sternly to the prostrate De Talor;
&ldquo;and never let me see your face again!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;But I haven&rsquo;t any money; where am I to go?&rdquo; groaned De
Talor.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Wherever you like, Mr. de Talor&mdash;this is a free country; but, if I
had control of your destination, it should be&mdash;to the devil!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The wretched man staggered to his feet.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;All right, Cardus; I&rsquo;ll go, I&rsquo;ll go. You&rsquo;ve got it all
your own way now. You are damned hard, you are; but perhaps you&rsquo;ll get it
taken out of you some day. I&rsquo;m glad you never got hold of Mary; it must
have been pleasant to you to see her marry Jones.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
In another second he was gone, and Mr. Cardus was left thinking, among other
things, of that look in old Atterleigh&rsquo;s eyes, which he could not get out
of his mind. Thus did he finally accomplish the revenge to which he had devoted
his life.

<h2><a name="chap45"></a>CHAPTER IX.<br/>
MAD ATTERLEIGH&rsquo;S LAST RIDE</h2>

<p>
A month had passed since Mr. de Talor had crept, utterly crushed, from the
presence of the man whom Providence had appointed to mete out to him his due.
During this time Mr. Cardus had been busy from morning till night. He was
always a busy man, writing daily with his own hand an almost incredible number
of letters; for he carried on all, or nearly all, his great affairs by
correspondence, but of late his work seemed to have doubled.
</p>

<p>
In the course of that month the society in the neighbourhood of Kesterwick
experienced a pleasurable sensation of excitement, for suddenly the De Talor
family vanished off the face of the Kesterwick world, and the Ceswick Ness
estates, after being advertised, were put up for sale, and bought, so said
report, by a London firm of lawyers on behalf of an unknown client. The De
Talors were gone, where to nobody knew, nor did they much care to
inquire&mdash;that is, with the exception of the servants whose wages were left
unpaid, and the tradespeople to whom large sums were owing. They inquired
vigorously enough, but without the smallest result; the De Talors had gone and
left no trace, except the trace of bankruptcy, and Kesterwick knew them no
more, but was glad over the sensation made by their disappearance.
</p>

<p>
But on one Saturday Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s business seemed to come to a sudden
stop. He wrote some letters and put them in the post-bag, and then he went to
admire his orchids.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Life,&rdquo; he said aloud to himself, &ldquo;shall be all orchids now;
my work is done. I will build a new house for Brazilian sons, and spend two
hundred pounds on stocking it. Well, I can afford it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
This was about five o&rsquo;clock. Half an hour later, when he had well
examined his flowers, he strolled out Titheburgh Abbey way, and here he met
Ernest and his wife, who had been sitting in their favourite spot.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, my dears,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and how are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Pretty well, uncle, thank you; and how are you?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I? Oh, I am very jolly indeed for an old man; as jolly as an individual
who has just bid good-bye to work for ever should be,&rdquo; he said.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Why, Reginald, what <i>do</i> you mean?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Mean, Dorothy, my dear? I mean that I have wound up my affairs and
retired on a modest competence. Ah, you young people should be grateful to me,
for let me tell you that everything is now in apple-pie order, and when I slip
off you will have no trouble at all, except to pay the probate duty, and that
will be considerable. I never quite knew till a week ago how rich I was; but,
as I said the other day, everything I have touched has turned to gold. It will
be a large fortune for you to manage, my dears; you will find it a great
responsibility.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I hope you will live many years to manage it yourself,&rdquo; said
Ernest.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, I don&rsquo;t know, I am pretty tough; but who can see the future?
Dolly, my dear girl,&rdquo; he went on, in a dreamy way, &ldquo;you are growing
like your mother. Do you know, I sometimes think that I am not far off her now;
you see I speak plainly to you two. Years ago I used to think&mdash;that is,
sometimes&mdash;that your mother was dust and nothing more; that she had left
me for ever; but of late I have changed my ideas. I have seen,&rdquo; he went
on, speaking in an absent way, as though he were meditating to himself,
&ldquo;how wonderfully Providence works even in the affairs of this imperfect
world, and I begin to believe that there must be a place where it allows itself
a larger development. Yes, I think I shall find your mother somewhere, Dorothy,
my dear. I seem to feel her very near me sometimes. Well, I have avenged
her.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I think that you will find her, Reginald,&rdquo; she answered;
&ldquo;but your vengeance is wicked and wrong. I have often made bold to tell
you so, though sometimes you have been angry with me, and I tell you so again.
It can only bring evil with it. What have we poor creatures to do with
vengeance, who do not understand the reason of things, and can scarcely see an
inch before our noses?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Perhaps you are right, my love&mdash;you generally are right in the
main; but my desire for vengeance upon that man De Talor has been the breath of
my nostrils, and behold! I have achieved it. Man, if he only lives long enough,
and has strength of will enough can achieve anything. But man fritters away his
powers over a variety of objects; he is led astray in pursuit of the butterfly
Pleasure, or the bubble Ambition, or the Destroying Angel Woman; and his
purposes fall to the ground between a dozen stools. Most men, too, are not
capable of a purpose. Men are weak creatures; and yet what a mighty seed lies
hid in every human breast! Think, my children, what man might, nay, may become,
when his weakness and follies have fallen from him, when his rudimentary
virtues have been developed, and his capacities for physical and mental
beauties brought to an undreamed of perfection! Look at the wild flower and the
flower of the hot-house&mdash;it is nothing compared to the possibilities
inherent in man, even as we know him. It is a splendid dream! Will it ever be
fulfilled, I wonder? Well, well&mdash;
</p>

<p class="poem">
&lsquo;Whatever there is to know<br/>
That we shall know one day.&rsquo;<br/>
</p>

<p>
Come, let us turn; it will soon be time to dress for dinner. By the way,
Dorothy, that reminds me. I don&rsquo;t quite like the way that your respected
grandfather is going on. I told him that I had no more deeds for him to copy,
that I had done with deeds, and he went and got that confounded stick of his,
and showed me that according to his own little calculations his time was up;
and then he got his slate and wrote about my being the devil on it, but that I
had no more power over him, and that he was bound for heaven. The other day,
too, I caught him staring at me through the glass of the door with a very queer
look in his eyes.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah, Reginald, so you have noticed it! I quite agree with you; I
don&rsquo;t at all like his goings-on. Do you know, I think that he had better
be shut up.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I don&rsquo;t like to shut him up, Dorothy. However, here we are; we
will talk about it to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Having led Ernest to his room, Dorothy, before beginning to dress herself, went
to the office to see if her grandfather was still there. And there, sure
enough, she found him, pacing up and down, muttering, and waving his long
stick, out of which all the notches had now been cut.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What are you doing, grandfather?&rdquo; she asked; &ldquo;why
haven&rsquo;t you gone to dress?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
He snatched up his slate and wrote rapidly upon it:
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Time&rsquo;s up! Time&rsquo;s up! Time&rsquo;s up! I&rsquo;ve done with
the devil and all his works. I&rsquo;m off to heaven on the big black horse to
find Mary. Who are you? You look like Mary.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Grandfather,&rdquo; said Dolly, quietly taking the slate out of his
hand, &ldquo;what do you mean by writing such nonsense? Let me hear no more of
it. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Now, mind, I will have no more of it.
Put away that stick, and go and wash your hands for dinner.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
The old man did as he was bid somewhat sulkily, Dorothy thought; but when he
arrived at the dinner-table there was nothing noticeable about his manner.
</p>

<p>
They dined at a quarter to seven, and dinner did not take them very long. When
it was over, old Atterleigh drank some wine, and then, according to his habit,
went and sat in the ancient ingle-nook which had presumably been built by the
forgotten Dum for his comfort on winter evenings. And on winter evenings, when
there was a jolly wood-fire burning on the hearth, it was a pleasant spot
enough; but to sit there in the dark on a lovely summer night was an act,
well&mdash;worthy of old Atterleigh.
</p>

<p>
After dinner the conversation turned upon that fatal day when Alston&rsquo;s
Horse was wiped out at Isandhlwana. It was a painful subject both to Ernest and
Jeremy, but the former was gratifying his uncle&rsquo;s curiosity by explaining
to him how that last dread struggle with the six Zulus came to determine itself
in their favour.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;And how was it,&rdquo; asked Mr. Cardus, &ldquo;that you managed to get
the better of the fellow you rolled down the hill with?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Because the assegai broke, and, fortunately enough, the blade was left
in my hand. Where is it, Doll?&rdquo; (for Jeremy had brought it home with
him.)
</p>

<p>
Dorothy got up and reached the broken assegai, which had about eight inches of
the shaft, from its place over the mantelpiece.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now then, Jeremy, if you would be so good as to sprawl upon your back on
the floor, I will just show my uncle what happened.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy complied, not without grumbling about dirtying his dress-coat.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Now, Jeremy, my boy, where are you? O, there! Well, excuse my taking the
liberty of kneeling on your chest, and holloa out if the assegai goes into you.
If we are going to have a performance at all, it may as well be a realistic
one. Now, uncle, you see when we finished rolling, which was just as this
assegai snapped in two, as luck would have it I was uppermost, and managed to
get my knee on my friend&rsquo;s left arm and to hold his right with my left.
Then, before he could get loose, I drove this bit of spear through the side of
his throat, just there, so that it cut the jugular vein, and he died shortly
afterwards; and now you know all about it.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Here Ernest rose and laid the spear upon the table, and Jeremy, entering into
the spirit of the thing, began to die as artistically as a regard for his
dress-coat would allow. Just then Dorothy, looking up, saw her grandfather
Atterleigh&rsquo;s distorted face peering round the wall of the ingle-nook,
where he was sitting in the dark, and looking at the scene of mimic slaughter
with that same curious gaze that he had worn on several occasions lately. He
withdrew his head at once.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Get up, Jeremy!&rdquo; said his sister, sharply, &ldquo;and stop
writhing about there like a great snake. You look as though you had been
murdered; it is horrible!&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Jeremy arose laughing, and, having obtained Dorothy&rsquo;s permission, they
all lit their pipes, and, sitting there in the fading light, fell to talking
about that sad scene of slaughter, which indeed appeared that night to have a
strange fascination for Mr. Cardus. He asked Ernest and Jeremy about it again
and again&mdash;how this man was killed, and that?&mdash;did they die at once?
and so on.
</p>

<p>
The subject was always distressing to Ernest, and one to which he rarely
alluded, full as it was for him of the most painful recollections, especially
those connected with his dear friend Alston and his son.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy knew this, and knew too that Ernest would be low spirited, for at least
a day after the conversation, which she did her best to stop. At last she
succeeded; but the melancholy associations connected with the talk had
apparently already done their work, for everybody lapsed into the most complete
silence, and sat grouped together at the top end of the old oak table as
quietly as though they were cut in stone. Meanwhile, the twilight deepened, and
little gusts of wind arose, and gently shook the old-fashioned window-lattices,
making a sound as though feeble hands were trying to throw them open. The dull
evening light crept from place to place, and threw great shadows about the
room, glanced upon the armour on its panelled walls, and at last began to die
away into darkness. The whole scene was eerie, and for some unknown reason it
oppressed Dorothy. She wondered why everybody was so silent, and yet she
herself did not feel equal to breaking the silence; there was a load upon her
heart.
</p>

<p>
Just then a curious thing happened. As may be remembered, the case containing
the wonderful mummied head, found by Eva Ceswick, had years before been placed
by Jeremy upon a bracket at the end of the room. Round about this case hung
various pieces of armour, and among others, above it, suspended by a piece of
string from a projecting hook, was a heavy iron gauntlet. For many
years&mdash;twenty or more&mdash;it had hung from the hook, but now at last the
string was worn through, and even as Dorothy was wondering at the silence it
gave. Down came the heavy iron hand with a crash, and, as it passed, it caught
the latch of the long air-tight case, and jarred the door wide open.
</p>

<p>
Everybody in the room sprang to their feet, and, as they did so, a last ray
from the setting sun struggled through one of the windows and rested upon the
open case, staining it, and all about it, the hue of blood, and filling the
fearful crystal eyes within with a lurid light. How they glowed and shone, to
be sure, after their long years of sleep!&mdash;for the case had scarcely been
opened for years&mdash;while their tremulous glance, now dull, now intense,
according as the light played upon them, appeared to wander round and round the
room, as though in search of somebody or something.
</p>

<p>
It was an awful sight which that ray of sunlight showed, as it played upon the
trembling crystal orbs, the scornful, deathly features, and the matchless hair
that streamed on either side. Together with the sudden break in the silence,
caused by the crashing fall of the gauntlet, as it had done many years before,
it proved altogether too much for the beholder&rsquo;s nerves.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;What is that?&rdquo; asked Ernest, with a start, as the gauntlet fell.
</p>

<p>
Dorothy glanced up and gave a little cry of horror. &ldquo;Oh, that dreadful
head! it is looking at us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
They all rose to their feet, and Dorothy, seizing Ernest by one hand, and
covering her eyes with the other, retreated, slowly followed by the others,
towards the swing-door. Soon they had reached the door, were through it, down
the passage, and out into the peaceful stillness of the evening. Then Jeremy
spoke, and his language was more forcible than polite.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Well, I am blowed!&rdquo; he said, wiping the cold perspiration from his
forehead.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, Reginald, I do wish you would get that horrible thing out of the
house; there has been nothing but misfortune ever since it has been here. I
cannot bear it, I cannot bear it!&rdquo; said Dolly, hysterically.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Nonsense, you superstitious child!&rdquo; answered Mr. Cardus, who was
now recovering from his start. &ldquo;The gauntlet knocked the door open, that
was all. It is nothing but a mummied head; but, if you don&rsquo;t like it, I
will send it to the British Museum to-morrow.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Oh, please do, Reginald,&rdquo; answered Dorothy, who appeared quite
unhinged.
</p>

<p>
So hurried had been their retreat from the room that everybody had forgotten
&ldquo;Hard-riding Atterleigh&rdquo; sitting in the dark in the ingle-nook. But
the bustle in the room had attracted him, and already, before they had left, he
had projected his large head covered with the tangled gray locks, and begun to
stare about. Presently his eyes fell upon the crystal orbs, and then, to him,
the orbs appeared to cease their wanderings and rest upon his eyes. For awhile
the two heads stared at each other thus&mdash;the golden head without a body in
the box, and the gray head that, thrust out as it were from the ingle-wall,
seemed to have no body either. They stared and stared, till at last the golden
head got the mastery of the grey head, and the old man crept from his corner,
crept down the room till he was almost beneath the baleful eyes, and <i>nodded,
nodded, nodded</i> at them.
</p>

<p>
And they, too, seemed to <i>nod, nod, nod</i> at him. Then he retreated
backwards as slowly as he had come, nodding all the while, till he came to
where the broken assegai lay upon the table, and, taking it, thrust it up his
sleeve. As he did so, the ray of light faded and the fiery eyes went out. It
was as though the thick white lids and long eyelashes had dropped over them.
</p>

<p>
None of the other four returned to the sitting-room that night.
</p>

<p>
When he had recovered from his fright, Jeremy went into his little room, the
same in which he used to stuff birds as a boy, and busied himself with his farm
accounts. Mr. Cardus, Dorothy, and Ernest walked about together in the balmy
moonlight, for, very shortly after the twilight had departed, the great
harvest-moon came up and flooded the world with light. Mr. Cardus was in a
talkative, excited mood that night. He talked about his affairs, which he had
now finally wound up, and about Mary Atterleigh, mentioning little tricks of
manner and voice which were reproduced in Dorothy. He talked too about
Ernest&rsquo;s and Dorothy&rsquo;s marriage, and said what a comfort it was to
him. Finally, about ten o&rsquo;clock, he said that he was tired and was going
to bed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;God bless you, my dears; sleep well! Good-night,&rdquo; he said.
&ldquo;We will settle about that new orchid-house to-morrow. Good-night,
good-night.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Shortly afterwards Dorothy and Ernest also went to bed, reaching their room by
a back entrance, for they neither of them felt inclined to come under the fire
of the crystal eyes again, and soon they were asleep in each other&rsquo;s
arms.
</p>

<p>
The minutes stole on one by one through the dead silence of the night, bearing
their records with them to the archives of the past. Eleven o&rsquo;clock came
and fled away; midnight came too, and swept on bat-like wings across the world.
Everywhere&mdash;on land, sky, and sea&mdash;there was silence, nothing but
silence sleeping in the moonlight.
</p>

<p class="p2">
</p>

<p>
<i>Hark!</i> Oh, heavens, what was that!
</p>

<p>
One fearful, heartrending yell of agony, ringing all through the ancient house,
rattling the casements, shaking the armour against the panelled walls, pulsing
and throbbing in horrible notes out into the night, echoing and dying far away
over the sea! And then silence again, silence sleeping in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
They sprang from their beds, did every living soul beneath that roof, and
rushed in their night-gear, men and women together, into the sitting-room. The
crystal eyes seemed to be awake again, for the moon was up and played upon
them, causing them now and then to flash out in gleams of opalescent light.
</p>

<p>
Somebody lit a candle, somebody missed Mr. Cardus; surely he could never have
slept through that! Yes, he had slept through it. They rushed and tumbled, a
confused mass of white, into the room where he lay. He was there sure enough,
and he slept very sound, with a red gash in his throat, from which the blood
fell in heavy drops, down, down to the ground.
</p>

<p>
They stood aghast, and as they stood, from the courtyard outside there came a
sound of galloping hoofs. They knew the sound of the galloping; it was that of
Ernest&rsquo;s great black stallion!
</p>

<p class="p2">
</p>

<p>
A mile or more away out on the marshes, just before you come to the well-known
quicksands, which have, tradition says, swallowed so many unfortunates, and
which shudder palpably at times and are unpleasant to look on, stands a
lock-house, inhabited by one solitary man, who has charge of the sluice. On
this very night it is necessary for him to open his sluice-gates at a
particular moment, and now he stands awaiting that propitious time. He is an
ancient mariner; his hands are in his pockets, his pipe is in his mouth, his
eyes are fixed upon the sea. We have met him before. Suddenly he hears the
sound of a powerful horse galloping furiously. He turns, and his hair begins to
rise upon his head, for this is what he sees in the bright moonlight:
</p>

<p>
Fast, fast towards him thunders a great coal-black horse, snorting with mingled
rage and terror, and on its bare back there sits a man with a grip of
iron&mdash;an old man, for his gray locks stream out behind him&mdash;who waves
above his head the fragment of a spear.
</p>

<p>
On they come. Before them is the wide sluice; if they are mortal, they will
turn or plunge into it. No; the great black horse gathers himself, and springs
into the air.
</p>

<p>
By Heaven, he has cleared it! No horse ever took that leap before, or will
again. On at whirlwind speed towards the shuddering quicksand two hundred yards
away!
</p>

<p>
<i>Splash!</i> Horse and man are in it, making the moist mass shake and tremble
for twenty yards round. The bright moonlight shows it all. The horse shrieks in
fear and agony, as only a horse can; the man on its back waves the spear.
</p>

<p>
The horse vanishes, the man vanishes; the spear glitters an instant longer in
the moonlight, and then vanishes too. They have all vanished for ever.
</p>

<p>
They have all vanished, and again the perfect silence sleeps in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Bust me!&rdquo; says the ancient one, aloud, and shaking with a mortal
dread; &ldquo;bust me, I have stood still and seed many a queer thing, but I
never seed a thing like that!&rdquo; And he turned and fled fast as his old
legs would carry him, forgetful of Dutch cheeses and of sluice-gates, forgetful
of everything except that demon horse and man.
</p>

<p>
Thus ended &ldquo;Hard-riding Atterleigh&rsquo;s&rdquo; maddest gallop, and
thus, too ended the story of Mr. Cardus and his revenge.

<h2><a name="chap46"></a>CHAPTER X.<br/>
DOROTHY&rsquo;S TRIUMPH</h2>

<p>
Some years passed before Eva Plowden returned to Kesterwick, and then she was
carried thither. Alive she did not return, nor during all those years did she
and Ernest ever meet.
</p>

<p>
They buried her, in obedience to her last wishes, there in the churchyard where
lay generation upon generation of her ancient race, and the daisies grew above
her head. Twice had they bloomed above her before Sir Ernest Kershaw stood by
the spot, hallowed by the presence of what once held the spirit of the woman he
had loved.
</p>

<p>
Ernest was now getting well into middle life, and Dorothy&rsquo;s bright hair
was slightly lined with gray, as they stood that summer evening by Eva&rsquo;s
grave. Many things had happened to the pair since Mr. Cardus&rsquo;s tragic
death. They had had children&mdash;some they had lost, some
remained&mdash;honest English lads and lasses, with their father&rsquo;s eyes.
They had enjoyed great wealth, and spent it royally, giving with both hands to
all who needed. They had drunk deep of the cup of this world&rsquo;s joys and
sorrows. Ernest had gone into Parliament for a couple of years, and made
something of a name there. Then, impatient for the active life of other days,
he had accepted a high Colonial appointment, for which, notwithstanding his
blindness, his wealth and parliamentary reputation eminently fitted him. Now he
was just about to leave to fill the governorship of one of the Australian
colonies.
</p>

<p>
Long years had passed, many things had happened; and yet as he stood by that
heap of turf, which he could not see, it seemed but yesterday when&mdash;and he
sighed.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Not quite cured yet, Ernest?&rdquo; said Dorothy, interrogatively.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Dorothy,&rdquo; he answered, with a little sigh, &ldquo;I think I
am cured. At any rate,&rdquo; he went on, as she took his hand to lead him away
from the grave, &ldquo;I have learned to accept the decrees of Providence
without murmuring. I have done with dreams, and outlived pessimism. Life would,
it is true, have been a different thing for me if poor Eva had not deserted me,
for she poisoned its waters at the fount, and so they have always tasted
bitter. But happiness is not the end and object of man&rsquo;s existence; and
if I could I do not think I would undo the past. Take me to the old flat
tombstone, Dolly, near the door.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She led him to it, and he sat down.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ah,&rdquo; he went on, &ldquo;how beautiful she was! Was there ever
woman like her, I wonder? And now her bones lie there; her beauty is all gone;
and there lives of her only the unending issues of <i>what she did.</i> I have
only to think, Dolly, and I can see her as I saw her a score of times passing
in and out of this church-door. Yes, I can see her, and the people round her,
and the clothes she wore, and the smile in her beautiful dark eyes&mdash;for
her eyes seemed to smile, you remember, Dolly. How I worshipped her, too, with
all my heart and soul and strength, as though she were an angel! And that was
my mistake, Dolly. She was only a woman&mdash;a weak woman.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;You said just now that you were cured, Ernest; one would hardly think it
to hear you talk,&rdquo; put in Dorothy, smiling.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Doll, I am cured; you have cured me, my dear wife, for you have
crept into my life, and taken possession of it, so that there is little room
for anybody else; and now, Dorothy, I love you with all my heart.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
She pressed his hand and smiled again, for she knew that she had triumphed, and
that he did love her, truly love her, and that his passion for Eva was a poor
thing compared to what it had been years before&mdash;more indeed of a tender
regret, not unmingled with a starry hope, than a passion at all. Dorothy was a
clever little person, and understood something of Ernest and the human heart in
general. She had thought long ago that she would win Ernest altogether to her
in the end. By what tenderness, by what devotion and nobility of character she
accomplished this, those who know her can well imagine, but in the end she did
accomplish it, as she deserved to. The contrast between the conduct of the two
women who had mainly influenced his life was too marked for Ernest, a man of a
just and reasonable mind, to altogether ignore; and when once he came to
comparisons the natural results followed. And yet, though he learned to love
Dorothy so dearly, it cannot be said that he forgot Eva; because there are
things that some men can never forget, since they are a part of their inner
life, and of these first love is unfortunately one.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; went on Dorothy, &ldquo;you remember what you told me
when you asked me to marry you in Titheburgh Abbey, about your belief that your
affection for Eva would outlast this world. Do you still believe that?&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, Doll, to a great extent.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
His wife sat and thought for a minute.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Ernest,&rdquo; she said presently.
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;Yes, dear.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I have managed to hold my own against Eva in this world, when she had
all the chances and all the beauty on her side, and what I have to say about
your theories now is, that when we get to the next, and are all beautiful, it
will be very strange if I don&rsquo;t manage to hold my own there. She had her
chance, and she threw it away; now I have got mine, and I don&rsquo;t mean to
throw it away, either in this world or the next.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
Ernest laughed a little. &ldquo;I must say, my dear, it would be a very poor
heaven if you were not there.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
&ldquo;I should think so, indeed. &lsquo;Those whom God hath joined together
let not man put asunder&rsquo;&mdash;nor woman either. But what is the good of
our stopping here to talk such stuff about things of which we really understand
nothing? Come, Ernest, Jeremy and the boys will be waiting for us.&rdquo;
</p>

<p>
And so hand in hand they went on homeward through the quiet twilight.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
